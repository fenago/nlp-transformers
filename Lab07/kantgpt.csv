prompt:The existence of these French versions  when taken
in connexion with the absence until very recently of any systematic
account of the Critique of Judgement in English  may be perhaps
explained by the livel,completion:y interest that was taken on the Continent in the
Philosophy of Art in the early part of the century; whereas scientific
studies on this subject received little attention in England during the

account has be,completion:en given of the phenomena of _feeling_  which play so
large a part in experience.
prompt:And this Kant saw before he had proceeded
very far with the Critique of Practical Reason; and in consequence
he ,completion:adopted a threefold classification of the higher mental faculties
based on that given by previous psychologists.
prompt:Knowledge  feeling 
desire  these are the three ultimate modes o,completion:f consciousness  of which
the second has not yet been described.
prompt:And when we compare this with
the former triple division which we took up,completion: from the Aristotelian
logic  we see that the parallelism is significant.
prompt:Understanding is
_par excellence_ the faculty of knowledge  and Reason the f,completion:aculty of
desire (these points are developed in Kant’s first two Critiques).
prompt:And
this suggests that the Judgement corresponds to the feeling of pleasure
and pain; it occupies a position intermediate between Understanding
,completion:and Reason  just as  roughly speaking  the feeling of pleasure is
intermediate between our perception of an object and our desire to
possess it.
prompt:And so the Critique of Judgement completes the whole undertaking
of criticism; its endeavour is to show that there are _a priori_
principles at the basis of Judgement just as there are in the case
of Understanding and of Reason; that these principles  like the
principles of Reason  are not con,completion:
prompt:The fundamental principle underlying the procedure of the Judgement is
seen to be that of the purposiveness of,completion:
prompt:By this means  nature is regarded by us as if
its particular empirical laws were not isolated and disparate  but
conne,completion:cted and in relation  deriving their unity in seeming diversity
from an intelligence which is at the source of nature.
prompt:It is only
by the assumption of such a principle that we can construe nature
to ourselves; and the principle is then said to be a tr,completion:anscendental
condition of the exercise of our judging faculty  but valid only for
the reflective  not for the determinant Judgement.
prompt:It gives us pleasure

prompt:In the
former case the aesthetical Judgement is brought to bear  in the latter
the teleological; and it thus appears that the Critique of Judgement
has tw,completion:o main divisions; it treats first of the philosophy of Taste  the
Beautiful and the Sublime in Nature; and secondly  of the Teleology of
nature’s working.

et Ápto_  in which these apparently distinct topics were combined;
“pulchrum esse  quod per se ipsum; aptum  au,completion:tem  quod ad aliquid

itself and the observer; but a useful object serves further ends.
prompt:Both 
however  may be brought under the higher category ,completion:
prompt:We have here then  in the first place  a basis for an _a priori_
Philo,completion:sophy of Taste; and Kant works out its details with great
elaboration.
prompt:He borrowed little from the writings of his predecessors ,completion:

We may call the faculty of cognition from principles _a priori_  _pure
Reason_  and the inquiry into its possibility and bounds generally the
Critique of pure Reason  although by this faculty we ,completion:
prompt:That [Critique]
goes merely into our faculty of knowing things _a priori_  and busies
itself therefore only with the _cognitive faculty_ to the exclusion
of the feeling of pleasure and pain and the faculty of desire; and of
the cognitive faculties it only concerns itself with _Understanding_,completion: 
according to its principles _a priori_  to the exclusion of _Judgement_
and _Reason_ (as faculties alike belonging to theoretical cognition) 
because it is found in the sequel that no other cognitive faculty but
the Understanding can furnish constitutive principles of cognition _a
priori_.
prompt:The Critique  then  which sifts them all  as regards the share
which each of the other faculties might pretend to have in the clear
possession of knowledge from its ow,completion:n peculiar root  leaves nothing but
what the _Understanding_ prescribes _a priori_ as law for nature as
the complex of phenomena (whose form also is given _a priori_).
prompt:It
relegates all other pure concepts under Ideas  which are transcendent
for our the,completion:
prompt:For they serve as regulative principles;
partly to check the dangerous pretensions of Understanding  as if
(because it can furnish _a priori_ the conditions of the possibility
of all things which it can know) it had thereby confined within
t,completion:hese bounds the possibility of all things in general; and partly to
lead it to the consideration of nature according to a principle of
completeness  although it can never attain to this  and thus to further
the final design of all knowledge.
prompt:It was then properly the _Understanding_ which has its special realm in
the _cognitive faculty_  so far as it contains constitutive principles
of cognition _a pri,completion:ori_  which by the Critique  comprehensively called
the Critique of pure Reason  was to be placed in certain and sole
possession[8] against all other competitors.

they give a rule _a ,completion:
prompt:A Critique of pure Reason  _i.e._ of our faculty of judging _a priori_
according to principles  would be incomplete  if the Judgement  which
as a cognitive faculty also makes claim to such principles  were not
treated as,completion:
prompt:For if such a system is one day to be
completed under the general name of Metaphysic (which it is possible
to achieve quite completely  and which is supremely important for the
use of Reason in every reference)  the soil for the,completion: edifice must be
explored by Criticism as deep down as the foundation of the faculty of
principles independent of experience  in order that it may sink in no
part  for this would inevitably bring about the downfall of the whole.
prompt:We can easily infer from the nature of the Judgement (whose right use
is so necessarily and so universally requisite  that by the name of
sound Understanding nothing else but this faculty is meant)  that it
must be a,completion:ttended with great difficulties to find a principle peculiar
to it; (some such it must contain _a priori_ in itself  for otherwise
it would not be set apart by the commonest Criticism as a special
cognitive faculty).
prompt:This principle must not be derived _a priori_ from
concepts  for these belong,completion:

this faculty.
prompt:For although they do not by themselves contribute to
the knowledge of things  yet they belong to the cognitive faculty
alone  and point to an immediate reference of this faculty to the
feeling of pleasure or pain according to some principle _a priori_;
without confusing this with what may be the determining ground of the
faculty of desire  which has its principles _a priori_ in concepts
of Reason.--In t,completion:
prompt:And so  though in this case such a principle _a priori_ can and must be
applied to the _cognition_ of the beings of the world  and opens out

prompt:But this reference is precisely the puzzle in the principle
of Judgement  which renders a special section for this faculty
necessary in the Critique; since the logical judging according to
concepts (from whi,completion:ch an immediate inference can never be drawn to the
feeling of pleasure and pain) along with their critical limitation  has
at all events been capable of being appended to the theoretical part of
Philosophy.
prompt:The examination of the faculty of taste  as the aesthetical Judgement 
is not here planned in reference to the formation or the culture of
tas,completion:te (for this will take its course in the future as in the past
without any such investigations)  but merely in a transcendental point
of view.
prompt:Hence  I trust that as regards the deficiency of the former
purpose it will be judged with i,completion:ndulgence  though in the latter point
of view it must be prepared for the severest scrutiny.
prompt:But I hope that
the great difficulty of solving a problem so involved by nature may
serve as excuse for some hard,completion:ly avoidable obscurity in its solution  if
only it be clearly established that the principle is correctly stated.

We proceed quite correctly if  as usual  we divide Philosophy  as
containing the principles of the rational cognition of things b,completion:y means
of concepts (not merely  as logic does  principles of the form of
thought in general without distinction of Objects)  into _theoretical_
and _practical_.
prompt:But then the concepts  which furnish their Object
to the principles of this rational cognition  must be specifically
distinct; otherwise they would not,completion:
prompt:Now there are only two kinds of concepts  and these admit as ma,completion:
prompt:_natural
concepts_ and t,completion:he _concept of freedom_.
prompt:The former render possible
_theoretical_ cognition according to principles _a priori_; the latter
in respect of this theoretical cognition only supplies in itself a
negative princi,completion:
prompt:Thus
Philosophy is correctly divided into two parts  quite distinct in
their principles; the theoretical part or _Natural Philosophy_  and
the pr,completion:actical part or _Moral Philosophy_ (for that is the name given
to the practical legislation of Reason in accordance with the concept
of freedom).
prompt:But up to the present a gross misuse of these expressions
has prevailed  both in t,completion:
prompt:For what is practical according
to natural concepts has been identified with the practical according
to the concept of freedom; and so with the like titles  ‘theoretica,completion:l’
and ‘practical’ Philosophy  a division has been made  by which in
fact nothing has been divided (for both parts might in such case have
principles of the same kind).
prompt:The will  regarded as the faculty of desire  is (in this,completion: view) one
of the many natural causes in the world  viz.
prompt:that cause which acts
in ,completion:accordance with concepts.
prompt:All that is represented as possible (or
necessary) by means of a will is called practically possible (or
necessary); as distinguished from the physical pos,completion:

rules of this kind are not called laws (like physical laws)  but only
precepts; because the will does not sta,completion:nd merely under the natural
concept  but also under the concept of freedom  in relation to which
its principles are called laws.
prompt:These with their consequences alone

name of practical  in contrast to pure  geometry  as,completion:

or the curbing of,completion: the inclinations and checking of the affections

or taken to constitute the second part of Philosophy in general.
prompt:For all these contain only rules of skill (and are consequently only
technically practical) for bringing about an effect that is possible
according to the ,completion:natural concepts of causes and effects  which  since
they belong to theoretical Philosophy  are subject to those precepts
as mere corollaries from it (viz.

claim no p,completion:lace in a special Philosophy called practical.

concept of freedom t,completion:
prompt:These  like the
rules which nature obeys  are called simply laws  but they do not  like
them  rest on sensuous conditions but on a supersensible pr,completion:inciple;
and accordingly they require for themselves a quite different part of
Philosophy  called practical  corresponding to its theoretical part.
prompt:We hence see that a complex of practical precepts given by Philosophy
does not constitute a distinct part of Philosophy  as opposed to the
theoretical part  because these ,completion:precepts are practical; for they might
be that  even if their principles were derived altogether from the
theoretical cognition of nature (as technically practical rules).

distinct branch of Philosophy is constituted only] if their principle

Critique of pure Reason; for it annulled the objections on the other

the purpose proposed by its laws  and consequently nature must be so

laws of freedom.--There must  therefore  be a ground of the _unity_
of the supersensible  which lies at the basi,completion:s of nature  with that
which the concept of freedom practically contains; and the concept
of this ground  although it does not attain either theoretically or
practically to a knowledge of the same  and hence has no peculiar

thought according to the principles of the one to that according to the

prompt:OF JUDGEMENT AS A FACULTY LEGISLATING _A PRIORI_

Judgement in general is,completion: the faculty of thinking the particular as
contained under the Universal.
prompt:If the universal (the rule  the
principle  the law) be given  the Judgement which subsumes the
particular under it (even if  as transcendental J,completion:udgement  it furnishes
_a priori_  the conditions in conformity with which subsumption under
that universal is alone possible) is _determinant_.
prompt:But if only the
particular be given for which the univers,completion:al has to be found  the
Judgement is merely _reflective_.
prompt:The determinant Judgement only subsumes under universal transcendental
laws given by the Understanding; the law is marked out for it  _a
priori_  and it has therefore no need to seek a law for itself in
order to be able to subordinate the particular in nature to the
universal.--But the forms of nature are so ,completion:
prompt:These  as empirical  may be contingent from the point
of view of _our_ Understanding  and yet  if they are to be called
laws (as the concept of a nature requires)  they must be regarded as
necessary in virtue of a principle of the unity of the manifold  though
it be unknown to us.--The reflective Judgement  whic,completion:

metaphysical if it asserts that their changes must have an _external_
cause.
prompt:For in the former case bodies need only be thought by means
of ontological predicates (pure concepts of Understanding)  _e.g._
substance  in order to cognise the proposition _a priori_; but in

though in a scattere,completion:d way  as sentences of metaphysical wisdom

in ,completion:respect of things under possible (not yet discovered) empirical
laws is merely reflection  think of nature in respect of the latter
according to _a principle of purposiveness_ for our cognitive faculty 
which then is expressed in the above maxims of the Judgement.

transcendental concept of a purposiveness of nature is neither a

ANALYTIC OF THE BEAUTIFUL




FIRST MOMENT

OF THE JUDGEMENT OF TASTE[12] ACCORDING TO QUALITY


§ 1.
prompt:_The judgement of taste is aesthetical_

In order to decide whether anything is beautiful or not  we refer the
representation  not by the Understanding ,completion:to the Object for cognition
but  by the Imagination (perhaps in conjunction with the Understanding)
to the subject  and its feeling of pleasure or pain.
prompt:The judgement of
taste is therefore not a judgement of cognition  and is consequently
not logical but,completion: aesthetical  by which we understand that whose
determining ground can be _no other than subjective_.
prompt:Every reference
of representations  even that of sensations  may be objective (and
then it signifies the real in an empirical representation); save only
the reference to t,completion:he feeling of pleasure and pain  by which nothing in
the Object is signified  but through which there is a feeling in the
subject  as it is affected by the representation.
prompt:To apprehend a regular  purposive building by means of one’s
cognitive faculty (whether in a clear or a confused way of
represen,completion:
prompt:Here the representation is altogether referred to the subject and
to i,completion:ts feeling of life  under the name of the feeling of pleasure
or pain.
prompt:This establishes a quite separate faculty of distinction
and of judgement  adding nothing to cognition  but only comparing
the given,completion:
prompt:Given representations in a judgement can be empirical
(consequently  aesthetical); but the judgement w,completion:hich is formed by means
of them is logical  provided they are referred in the judgement to the
Object.
prompt:Conversely  if the given representations are rational  but are
referred in a judgemen,completion:t simply to the subject (to its feeling)  the
judgement is so far always aesthetical.
prompt:§ ,completion:2.
prompt:_The satisfaction which determines the judgement of taste is
disinterested_

The satisfactio,completion:n which we combine with the representation of the
existence of an object is called interest.
prompt:Such satisfaction always
has reference to the faculty of desire  either as it,completion:s determining
ground or as necessarily connected with its determining ground.
prompt:Now
when the question is if a thing is beautiful  we do not want to know
whether anything depends or can depend on the exis,completion:
prompt:If any one asks me if I find
that palace beautiful which I see before me  I may ,completion:answer: I do not
like things of that kind which are made merely to be stared at.
prompt:Or I
can answer like that Iroquois _sachem_ who was pl,completion:eased in Paris by
nothing more than by the cook-shops.
prompt:Or again after the manner of
_Rousseau_ I may rebuke the vanity of th,completion:e great who waste the sweat of
the people on such superfluous things.
prompt:In fine I could easily convince
myself that if I found myself on an uninhabited island without the
hope of ever again coming among men  and cou,completion:ld conjure up just such
a splendid building by my mere wish  I should not even give myself
the trouble if I had a sufficiently comfortable hut.
prompt:This may all be
admitted and approved,completion:; but we are not now talking of this.
prompt:We wish
only to know if this mere representation of the object is accompanied
in me with satisfac,completion:tion  however indifferent I may be as regards the
existence of the object of this representation.
prompt:We easily see that
in saying it is _beautiful_ and in showing that I have taste  I am
concerned  not with that i,completion:
prompt:Every one must admit that a judgement about beauty  in which
the least ,completion:interest mingles  is very partial and is not a pure judgement
of taste.
prompt:We must not be in the least prejudiced in favour of the
existence of the things  but,completion:

capital importance  than by contrasting the pure disinterested[13]
satisfaction in judgements of taste  wit,completion:

prompt:_The satisfaction in the_ PLEASANT _is bound up with interes,completion:
prompt:Here the
opportunity presents itself of censuring a very common confusion of
the,completion: double sense which the word sensation can have  and of calling
attention to it.
prompt:All satisfaction (it is said or though,completion:
prompt:Consequently everything that pleases is
pleasant because it pleases (and according to its different degrees
,completion:or its relations to other pleasant sensations it is _agreeable_ 
_lovely_  _delightful_  _enjoyable_  etc.).
prompt:But if this be admitted 
then impressions of Sense which determine the inclination  fundamental
propositions of Reason which determine the Wi,completion:ll  mere reflective forms
of intuition which determine the Judgement  are quite the same  as
regards the effect upon the feeling of pleasure.
prompt:For this would be
pleasantness in the sensation of one’s state  and since in the end all
the operations of our faculties must issue in the practical and un,completion:
prompt:It is of no consequence at all how this is attained  and
since then the choice of means alone could make a diffe,completion:rence  men could
indeed blame one another for stupidity and indiscretion  but never for
baseness and wickedness.
prompt:For all  each according to his own way of
seein,completion:
prompt:If a determination of the feeling of pleasure or pain is called
sensation  this expression signifies something quite different fro,completion:m
what I mean when I call the representation of a thing (by sense  as a
receptivity belonging to the cognitive faculty) sensation.
prompt:For in the
latter case the representation is referred to the Object  in the former
simply to the subjec,completion:
prompt:In the above elucidation we understand by the word sensation 
an objective representation of sense; and in order to avoid
misinterpretation  we shall call that  which must always remain merely
subjective and can constitute absolutely no representation of an
object  by the ordinary term “feeling.” The green col,completion:our of the meadows
belongs to _objective_ sensation  as a perception of an object of
sense; the pleasantness of this belongs to _subjective_ sensation by
which no object is represented  _i.e._ to feeling  by which the object
is considered as an Object of satisfaction (which does not furnish a
cognition of it).
prompt:Now that a judgement about an object  by which I describe it as
pleasant  expresses an interest in it  is plain from the fact that by
sensation it excites a desire for objects of,completion:
prompt:Hence we do not merely say of the pleas,completion:ant  _it
pleases_; but  _it gratifies_.
prompt:I give to it no mere approval  but
inclination is aroused by it; and in the case of what is pleasant
in the most lively fashion  there is no judgement at all upon the
charac,completion:ter of the Object  for those who always lay themselves out only
for enjoyment (for that is the word describing intense gratification)
would fain dispense with all judgement.
prompt:§ ,completion:4.
prompt:_The satisfaction in the_ GOOD _is bound up with interest_

What,completion:
prompt:That which pleases only as a means we call _good for something_ (t,completion:he
useful); but that which pleases for itself is _good in itself_.
prompt:In both
there is always involved the concept of a purpose  and consequently
the relation of Reason to the (at least p,completion:ossible) volition  and thus a
satisfaction in the _presence_ of an Object or an action  _i.e._ some
kind of interest.
prompt:In order to find anything good  I must always know what sort of a,completion:
prompt:But
there is no need of this,completion:  to find a thing beautiful.
prompt:Flowers  free
delineations  outlines intertwined with one another without design
and,completion:
prompt:The satisfaction in the beautiful must depend
on the reflection upon an object  leading to any concept (,completion:however
indefinite); and it is thus distinguished from the pleasant which rests
entirely upon sensation.
prompt:It is true  the Pleasant seems in ma,completion:ny cases to be the same as the
Good.
prompt:Thus people are accustomed to say that all gratification
(especially if it lasts) is good in ,completion:
prompt:But
we can soon see that this is merely a confusion of words; for the
concep,completion:ts which properly belong to these expressions can in no way be
interchanged.
prompt:The pleasant  which  as such  represents the object
simply in relation to Sense  must first be brought by,completion: the concept of
a purpose under principles of Reason  in order to call it good  as an
object of the Will.
prompt:But that there is [involved] a quite different
relation to satisfaction in calling that which gratifies at the same
time _good_  may be seen from the fact that in the case of the good the
question always is  whether it ,completion:is mediately or immediately good (useful
or good in itself); but on the contrary in the case of the pleasant
there can be no question about this at all  for the word always
signifies something which pleases immediately.
prompt:(The same is applicable
t,completion:o what I call beautiful.)

the after results  it displeases.

opposed to this.
prompt:Pleasantness ,completion:is enjoyment.
prompt:And if we were concerned
with this alone  it would be foolish to be scrupulous as regards the
means which procure,completion:
prompt:But Reason can never be persuaded that the existence of a man who
merely lives for _enjoyment_ (however busy he may be in this point of
view)  has a wo,completion:rth in itself; even if he at the same time is conducive
as a means to the best enjoyment of others  and shares in all their
gratifications by sympathy.
prompt:Only what he does  without reference to
enjoyment  in full freedom and independently of what nature can procure
for him passively  gives an [absolute[1,completion:

interest.
prompt:For the good is the Object of will (_i.e._ o,completion:f a faculty of
desire determined by Reason).

identical.

prompt:But this

taste is not a cognitive judgeme,completion:nt (either theoretical or practical)

prompt:The Pleasant  the Beautiful  and the Good  designate then  three
different relations of representations to the feelin,completion:g of pleasure and

every one says that hunger is the best sauce  and everything that is,completion:
eatable is relished by people with a healthy appetite; and thus a
satisfaction of this sort does not indicate choice directed by taste.

§ 6.
prompt:_The beautiful is that which apart from concepts is represented as
the object of a universal satisfaction_

This explanation ,completion:of the beautiful can be derived from the preceding
explanation of it as the object of an entirely disinterested
satisfaction.
prompt:For the fact of which every one is conscious  that the
satisfaction is for him qui,completion:te disinterested  implies in his judgement a
ground of satisfaction for every one.
prompt:For since it does not rest on any
inclination of the subject (nor upon any other premeditated interest) 
but since he who judges feels himself quite _free_ as regards the
satisfaction which he attaches to,completion:
prompt:Consequently he must believe that he has
reason fo,completion:r attributing a similar satisfaction to every one.

an interest with them such as is not bound up with the pure judgement

prompt:To strive here with the design of
reproving as incorrect another man’s judgement which ,completion:is different from
our own  as if the judgements were logically opposed  would be folly.
prompt:As regards the pleasant therefore the fundamental proposition,completion:
prompt:The case is quite diffe,completion:
prompt:It would (on the
contrary) be laughable if a man who imagined anything to his own taste 
thought to justify himself by saying: “This object (the house we see 
the coat,completion: that person wears  the concert we hear  the poem submitted
to our judgement) is beautiful _for me_.” For he must not call it
_beautiful_ if it merely pleases himself.
prompt:Many things may have for
him charm and pleasantness; no one troubles himself at that; but if
he gives out anything as beautiful  he supposes ,completion:
prompt:Hence he says
“the _thing_ is beautiful”; and he does not count on the agreement of
others with this his judg,completion:ement of satisfaction  because he has found

blames them if they judge otherwise and he denies ,completion:them taste  which he
nevertheless requires from them.

rightful claim to validity for every one; but the Good is represented
only _b,completion:y means of a concept_ as the Object of a universal satisfaction 
which is the case neither with the Pleasant nor with the Beautiful.
prompt:§ ,completion:8.
prompt:_The universality of the satisfaction is represented in a
judgement of Taste only as subjective_

This particular determination of the universality of an ,completion:
prompt:It requires no small trouble to discover its origin  but
we thus detect a prop,completion:
prompt:First  we must be fully convinced of the fact that in a judgement
of taste (about the Beautiful) the satisfact,completion:ion in the object is
imputed to _every one_  without being based on a concept (for then
it would be the Good).
prompt:Further  this claim to universal validity so
essentially belongs to a judgement by which we describe anything as
_beautiful_  that if this were not thoug,completion:
prompt:In respect
of the latter every one has his own opinion; and no one assumes  in
another  agreem,completion:
prompt:I may call the first the
taste of Sense  the second the taste of Reflection; so far as the
first lays down mere private judgements  and the second judgements
supposed to be generally,completion: valid (public)  but in both cases aesthetical
(not practical) judgements about an object merely in respect of the
relation of its representation to the feeling of pleasure and pain.
prompt:Now here is som,completion:ething strange.
prompt:As regards the taste of Sense not only
does experience show that its judgement (of pleasure or pain connected
with anything) is not valid universally  bu,completion:
prompt:On the
other hand  the taste of Reflection has its claim to the universal
validity of its judgements (about the beautiful) rejected often
enough ,completion: as experience teaches; although it may find it possible (as it
actually does) to represent judgements which can demand this universal
agreement.
prompt:In fact for each of its judgements of taste it imputes
this to every one  without the persons that judge disputing as to th,completion:
prompt:Here we must  in the first place  remark that a universality which
does not rest on concepts of Objects (not even on empirical o,completion:
prompt:For this I use
the expression _general validity_ which signifies the validity of the
reference of a re,completion:presentation  not to the cognitive faculty but  to the
feeling of pleasure and pain for every subject.
prompt:(We can avail ourselves
also of the same expression for the logical quantity of the judgement 
if only we prefi,completion:x _objective_ to “universal validity ” to distinguish
it from that which is merely subjective and aesthetical.)
prompt:A judgement with _objective universal validity_ is also always valid
subjectively; _i.e._ if the judgement holds for ev,completion:
prompt:But from a _subjective universal
validity_  _i.e._ aesthetical and resting on no concept  we ca,completion:nnot
infer that which is logical; because that kind of judgement does not
extend to the Object.
prompt:Hence the aesthetical universality which is
ascribed to a judgement must be of a particular kind  because it does
not unite the predicate of,completion: beauty with the concept of the _Object_ 
considered in its whole logical sphere  and yet extends it to the whole
sphere of judging persons.

a judgement of ta,completion:
prompt:But the
judgement which results from the comparison of several singular
judgements  “Roses in general are bea,completion:utiful” is no longer described
simply as aesthetical  but as a logical judgement based on an

judgement of Taste carries with it an _aesthetical quan,completion:
prompt:It is only judgements about the Good
which--although they also determine satisfaction in an object --have
logical and not,completion: merely aesthetical universality; for they are valid of
the Object  as cognitive of it  and thus are valid for every one.
prompt:If we judge Objects merely according to concep,completion:ts  then all
representation of beauty is lost.
prompt:Thus there can be no rule according
to which any one,completion: is to be forced to recognise anything as beautiful.
prompt:We cannot press [upon others] by the aid of any reasons or fundamental
p,completion:
prompt:We wish to submit the Object to our own eyes  as if the
satisfaction in it depended on sensation; and yet if we then call the
object beautiful  we believe that we speak w,completion:ith a universal voice  and
we claim the assent of every one  although on the contrary all private
sensation can only decide for the observer himself and his satisfaction.
prompt:We may see now that in the judgement of taste nothing is postulated but
such a _universal voice_  in respect of the satisfaction without the

prompt:The judgement of taste itself does not _postulate_ the agreement
of every one (for that can only be done by a logically universal
judgement because it can adduce r,completion:easons); it only _imputes_ this
agreement to every one  as a case of the rule in respect of which it
expects  not confirmation by concepts  but assent from others.
prompt:The
universal voice is  therefore  only an Id,completion:
prompt:It may be uncertain whether or not the man  who
believes that he is laying down a judgement of taste  is  as a matter
of fact  judging in conformity with that Idea; but that he refers his
judgement thereto  and  consequently  that it is intended to be a
judgement of taste  he announces by the expression “beauty.” He can
be quite certain of this for himself by,completion: the mere consciousness of the
separation of everything belonging to the Pleasant and the Good from
the satisfaction which is left; and this is all for which he promises
himself the agreement of every one--a claim which would be justifiable
under these conditions  provided only he did not often make mistakes 
and thus lay down an erroneous judgement of taste.

resting always on that relation as its subjective condition.

If we wish to explain what a purpose is according to its transcendental
determinations (without presupposing anything empirical like the
feeling of pleasure) [we say that] the purpose is the ,completion:object of a
concept  in so far as the concept is regarded as the cause of the
object (the real ground of its possibility); and the causality of a
_concept_ in respect of its _Object_ is its purposiveness (_forma

it is the mere form of purposiveness in the representation by which

constitutes the satisfaction that we without a concept judge to be

the bounds of experience and call in a ca,completion:usality which rested on a
supersensible attribute of the subject  viz.

prompt:And even there 
properly speaking  it was not this _feeling_ which we derived ,completion:from the
Idea of the moral as cause  but merely the determination of the will.
prompt:But the state of mind which accompanies any determination of the will
is in itself a feeli,completion:ng of pleasure and identical with it  and therefore
does not follow from it as its effect.

if the concept of the moral as a good precede the determination of the
will by the law;,completion:
prompt:Now the case is similar with the pleasure in aesthetical judgements 
only that here it is merely contemplative an,completion:d does not bring about
an interest in the Object  which on the other hand in the moral
judgement it is practical.
prompt:[24] The consciousness of the mere formal
purposiveness in the play of the subject’s cognitive powers  in a
representation through which an object is given  is the pleasure
itself; because it contains a determining ground of the activity of
the subject in respect of the excitement of ,completion:

Every interest spoils the judgement of taste and takes from its

interest of Reason  placed before the feeling of pleasure but grounded
on it.

prompt:But the other [the feeling

prompt:Self-subsisting natural beauty discovers to us a Technic of nature 
which represents it as a system in a,completion:ccordance with laws  the principle
of which we do not find in the whole of our faculty of Understanding.
prompt:That principle is the principle of purposiveness  in respect of the use
of our Judgement in regard to phenomena; [which requires] that t,completion:hese
must not be judged as merely belonging to nature in its purposeless
mechanism  but also as belonging to something analogous to art.
prompt:It 
therefore  actually extends  not indeed our cognition of natural
Objects  but,completion: our concept of nature; [which is now not regarded] as
mere mechanism but as art.
prompt:This leads to profound investigations,completion:
prompt:But in what we are accustomed to call
sublime there is nothing at all that leads to particular objective
principles and forms of nature corresponding to them; so far from it

chaos or in its wildest and most irregular disorder and desolation 
provided size and might are perceived.
prompt:Hence  we see that the concept
of the Sublime is not nearly so important or rich in consequences
as the concept of the Beautiful; and that in general it displays
nothing p,completion:urposive in nature itself  but only in that possible use of
our intuitions of it by which there is produced in us a feeling of
a purposiveness quite independent of nature.
prompt:We must seek a ground
external to ourselves for the Beautiful of nature; but seek it for
the Sublime merel,completion:
prompt:This is a
very needful preliminary remark  which quite separates the Ideas of
the sublime from that of a purposiveness of _nature_  and makes the
theory of the sublime a mere appendix to the aesthet,completion:ical judging of
that purposiveness; because by means of it no particular form is
represented in nature  but there is only developed a purposive use
which the Imagination makes of its representation.
prompt:§ ,completion:
prompt:_Of the divisions of an investigation into the feeling of the
sublime_

As regards the division of the moments of the aesthetical judging of
objects in ,completion:reference to the feeling of the sublime  the Analytic can
proceed according to the same principle as was adapted in the analysis
of judgements of taste.
prompt:For as an act of the aesthetical reflective
Judgement  the satisfaction in the Sublime must be represented just as
in the case of the Beautiful --according to _quantit,completion:y_ as universally
valid  according to _quality_ as devoid of _interest_  according to
_relation_ as subjective purposiveness  and according to _modality_ as
necessary.
prompt:And so the method here will not diverge from that of the
preceding section; unless  indeed  we count it a difference that in
the case where the aesthetical Judgement is concerned with the form of
the Object we began ,completion:with the investigation of its quality  but here 
in view of the formlessness which may belong to what we call sublime 
we shall begin with quantity  as the first moment of the aesthetical
judgement as to the sublime.

prompt:And
hence we have this twofold ,completion:
prompt:A.--OF THE MATHEMATI,completion:
prompt:_Explanation of the term “sublime”_

We call,completion: that _sublime_ which is _absolutely great_.
prompt:But to be great 
and to be a great something are qui,completion:te different concepts (_magnitudo_
and _quantitas_).
prompt:In like manner to _say simply_ (_simpliciter_)
that anything is _great_ is quite diff,completion:erent from saying that it is
_absolutely great_ (_absolute  non comparative magnum_).
prompt:The latter
is _what is great beyond all comparison_.--What now is mean,completion:t by the
expression that anything is great or small or of medium size?
prompt:It is not
a pure concept of Understanding that is thus signified; still less is
it an intuition of Sen,completion:se  and just as little is it a concept of Reason 
because it brings with it no principle of cognition.
prompt:It must therefore
be a concept of Judgement or derived from one; and a subjective
pur,completion:posiveness of the representation in reference to the Judgement must
lie at its basis.

prompt:If now I say simply that anything is great  it appears that I have no
comparison in view  at least,completion: none with an objective measure; because
it is thus not determined at all how great the object is.
prompt:But although
the standard of comparison is merely subjective  yet the judgement none
the less claims universal assent; “this man is beautiful ” ,completion:and “he is
tall ” are judgements not limited merely to the judging subject  but 
like theoretical judgements  demanding the assent of every one.
prompt:In a judgement by which anything is designated simply as great  it
is not merely meant that the object has a magnitude  but that this,completion:
magnitude is superior to that of many other objects of the same kind 
without  however  any exact determination of this superiority.
prompt:Thus
there is always at the basis of our judgement a standard which we
assume as the same for every one; this  however  is not available for
any logical (mathematically definit,completion:e) judging of magnitude  but only
for aesthetical judging of the same  because it is a merely subjective
standard lying at the basis of the reflective judgement upon
magnitude.
prompt:It may be empirical  as  _e.g._ the average size of the men
known ,completion:
prompt:Or it may be a standard given _a priori_  which through the
defects of the judging subject is limited by the subjective conditions
of presentation _in concreto_; as  _e.g._ in the practical sphere  the
greatnes,completion:s of a certain virtue  or of the public liberty and justice in
a country; or  in the theoretical sphere  the greatness of the accuracy
or the inaccuracy of an observation or measurement that has been made 
etc.
prompt:Here it is remarkable that  although we have no interest whatever in an
Object --_i.e._ its existence is indifferent to us --yet its mere size 
even if it is considered as formless  ,completion:may bring a satisfaction with it
that is universally communicable  and that consequently involves the
consciousness of a subjective purposiveness in the use of our cognitive
faculty.
prompt:This is not indeed a satisfaction in the Object (because
it may be formless)  as in the case of the Beautiful  in which the
reflective Judgemen,completion:t finds itself purposively determined in reference
to cognition in general; but [a satisfaction] in the extension of the
Imagination by itself.
prompt:If (under the above limitation) we say simply of an object “it is
great ” this is no mathematically definite judgement but a mere
judgement of reflection upon the representation of it  which is
subjectively purposive for a certain use of our cognitive powers in
the estimation of magni,completion:tude; and we always then bind up with the
representation a kind of respect  as also a kind of contempt for what
we simply call “small.” Further  the judging of things as great or
small extends to everything  even to all their characteristics; thus
we describe beauty as great or small.
prompt:The reason of this is to be
sought in the fact that whatever we present in intuition according to
the ,completion:precept of the Judgement (and thus represent aesthetically) is
always a phenomenon and thus a quantum.
prompt:But if we call anything not only great  but absolutely great in every
point of view (great beyond all comparison)  _i.e._ su,completion:blime  we soon
see that it is not permissible to seek for an adequate standard of this

prompt:Consequently it is the state
of mind produced by a certain representation with which t,completion:he reflective
Judgement is occupied  and not the Object  that is to be called sublime.

does not bring with it any charm or emotion produced by actual danger)
merely as containing magnitude.

nature contains nothing monstrous (either magnificent or horrible);
the magnitude t,completion:hat is apprehended may be increased as much as you
wish provided it can be comprehended in a whole by the Imagination.
prompt:An object is _monstrous_ if by its size it destroy,completion:s the purpose which
constitutes the concept of it.
prompt:But the mere presentation of a concept
is called _colossal_  which is almost too great for any presentation
(bordering on the relatively monstrous); because the purpose of

intuition of the obj,completion:ect being almost too great for our faculty of
apprehension.--A pure judgement upon the sublime must  however  have

prompt:*       *       *       *       *

Because everything which is to give disinterested pleasure to the
merely reflective Judgement must bring with the representation
of it  subjective and  as subjective  universally valid
purposiveness--although no purposiveness of the _form_ of the
object lies (as in the case of the Beautiful) at the ground of the
judgemen,completion:t--the question arises “what is this subjective purposiveness?”
And how does it come to be prescribed as the norm by which a ground
for universally valid satisfaction is supplied in the mere estimation
of magnitude  even in that which is forced up to the point where our
faculty of Imagination is inadequate for the presentation of the
concept of magnitude?
prompt:In the process of combination requisite for the estimation of
magnitude  the Imagination proceeds of itself to infinity without

we only go to a certain point whether we push the comprehension of
the units up to the number 10 (as in the decimal scale) or only up to

proceeds by combination or  if the quantum is given in intuition  by
apprehension  but merely by way of progression (not of comprehension)
in accordance with an assumed principle of progression.
prompt:In this
mathematical estimation of magnitude the Understanding is equally
served and contented whether the Imagination chooses for unit a
magnitude that we can take in in a glance  _e.g._ a foot or rod  or a
German mile or even the earth,completion:
prompt:In both
cases the logical estimation of magn,completion:itude goes on without hindrance to
infinity.
prompt:But now the mind listens to the voice of Reason which  for every given
magnitude --even for those that can never be,completion: entirely apprehended 
although (in sensible representation) they are judged as entirely

in fact make the heart languid  insensible to the severe precept of

own person  and for the rights of men (a very different thing from

hypocritical repentance and in a mere passive state of mind--these are
not compatible with any frame of mind that can be counted beautiful

but a small sacrifice.

is the cause) for the evils which fate brings upon others --but for
those things which men do to one another (which depends upon an
antipathy in fundamental propositions)  is sublime  because it rests
upon Ideas  whilst the former can only count as beautiful.--The
brilliant and thorough _Saussure_ [60] in his account of his Alpine

which men might wish to transport themselves that they might neither
hear nor experience any more of the world; which  however  would not
be quite so inhospitable that it would offer only an extremely painful
retreat.--I make this remark solely with the design of indicating
again that even depression (not dejected sadness) may be counted among
the _sturdy_ affections  if it has its ground in moral Ideas.

to be regarded as the most important author who adopts this mode of
treatment  infers by this method “that the feeling of the Sublime
rests on the impulse towards self-preservation and on _fear_  _i.e._
on a pain  which not going so far as actually to derange the parts of
the body  produces movements which  since they purify the finer or
grosser vessels of dangerous or troublesome stoppages  are capable
of exciting pleasant sensations; not indeed pleasure  but a kind of
satisfying horror  a certain tranquillity tinged with terror.”[61] The
Beautiful  which he founded on love (which he wishes to keep quite
se,completion:parate from desire)  he reduces to “the relaxing  slackening  and
enervating of the fibres of the body  and a consequent weakening 
languor  and exhaustion  a fainting  dissolving  and melting away for
enjoyment.”[62] And he confirms this explanation not only by cases in
which the Imagination in combination with the Understanding can excite
in us the feeling of the Beautiful or of the Sublime  but by cases in
which it is combined with sensation.--As psychological observations 
these analyses of the phenomena of our mind are exceedingly beautiful

The judgement of taste determines its object in respect of satis,completion:faction

prompt:And yet thi,completion:
prompt:For a judgement
of taste consists in calling a thing beautiful just because of that
c,completion:haracteristic in respect of which it accommodates itself to our mode
of apprehension.
prompt:Moreover  it is required of every judgement which is to prove the
taste of the subject  that the subject shall judge by himself  without
needing to grope about empirically among the judgements of others  and
acquaint ,completion:himself previously as to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction
with the same object; thus his judgement should be pronounced _a
priori_  and not be a mere imitation because the thing actually gives
universal pleasure.
prompt:One would think  however  that an _a priori_
judgement must contain a concept of the Object  for the cognition of
which it contains the ,completion:principle; but the judgement of taste is not
based upon concepts at all  and is in general not a cognitive but an
aesthetical judgement.
prompt:Thus a young poet does not permit himself to be dissuaded from his
conviction that his poem is beautiful  by the judgement of the public
or of his friends; and if he gives ear to them he does so  not because
he now,completion: judges differently  but because  although (in regard to him)

_Batteux_[67] or _Lessing_ or still more ancient and famous critics
of taste  and all the rules laid down by them; certain passages which
displease me may agree very well with rules of beauty (as th,completion:ey have
been put forth by these writers and are universally recognised): but
I stop my ears  I will listen to no arguments and no reasoning; and I
will rather assume that these rules of the critics are false  or at
least that they do not apply to the case in question  than admit that
my judgement should be determined by grounds of proof _a priori_.
prompt:For
it is to be a judgement of Taste,completion: and not of Understanding or Reason.
prompt:It seems that this is one of the chief reasons why this aesth,completion:etical

predicate of things of a certain species.

Critique of Taste is only subjective as regards ,completion:

in general_

The judgement of taste is distinguished from a logical judgement in
this  that the latter subsumes a representation under t,completion:he concept

of subsumption  not of intuitions under concepts  but of the _faculty_

_Newton_ has set forth in his immortal work on the Principles of
Natural Philosophy  however great a head was req,completion:uired to discover it;
but we cannot learn to write spirited poetry  however express may be
the precepts of the art and however excellent its models.
prompt:The reason
is that _Newton_ could make all his steps  from the first elements
of geometry to his own great and prof,completion:ound discoveries  intuitively
plain and definite as regards consequence  not only to himself but
to every one else.
prompt:But a _Homer_ or a _Wieland_ cannot show how his

his head  simply because he does not know and therefore cannot teach
others.

from his laborious imitator,completion: and pupil; but he differs specifically
from him whom Nature has gifted for beautiful Art.

For _judging_ of beautiful objects as such  _taste_ is requ,completion:isite;

_genius_ is requisite.
prompt:If we consider genius as the talent for beautiful art (which the
special meaning of the word implies) and in this point of view analyse
it into the faculties which must concur to constitute such a talent  it
is necessary in the fir,completion:st instance to determine exactly the difference
between natural beauty  the judging of which requires only Taste  and
artificial beauty  whose possibility (to which reference must be made
in judging such an object) requires Genius.

agreement of the manifold in a thing with its inner destination  its

such things] to be represented only by an allegory or attribute[81]
that has a pleasing effect  and thus only indirectly by the aid of the

prompt:_Remark II._

The following important remark occurs here: There are _three kinds of
Antinomies_ of pure Reason  which  however  all agree in this  that
they compel us to give up the otherwise very natural hypothesis that
objects ,completion:of sense are things in themselves  and force us to regard them
merely as phenomena  and to supply to them an intelligible substrate
(something supersensible of which the concept is only an Idea  and
supplies no proper knowledge).
prompt:Without such antinomies Reason could
never decide upon accepting a principle narrowing so much the field of
its s,completion:peculation  and could never bring itself to sacrifices by which so
many otherwise brilliant hopes must disappear.
prompt:For even now when  by
way of compensation for these losses  a greater field in a practical
aspect opens out before ,completion:it  it appears not to be able without grief to
part from those hopes  and disengage itself from its old attachment.
prompt:That there are three kinds of antinomies has its ground in this  that
there are three cognitive faculties --Underst,completion:anding  Judgement  and
Reason; of which each (as a superior cognitive faculty) must have
its _a priori_ principles.
prompt:For Reason  in so far as it judges of
these principles and their use  inexorably requires  in respect of
them all  the unconditioned for the given conditioned; and this can
never be found if we consider the sensible as bel,completion:onging to things
in themselves  and do not rather supply to it  as mere phenomenon 
something supersensible (the intelligible substrate of nature both
external and internal) as the reality in itself [Sache an sich selbst].
prompt:There are then: (1) _For the cognitive faculty_ an antinomy of Reason
in respect of the theoretical employment of the Understanding extended
to the unconditioned; (2) _for the feeling of pleasure and pain_ an
antinomy of Reason in respect of the aesthetical employment of the
Judgement; and (3) _for the faculty of desi,completion:re_ an antinomy in respect
of the practical employment of the self-legislative Reason; so far as
all these faculties have their superior principles _a priori_  and  in
conformity with an inevitable requirement of Reason  must judge and be
able to determine their Object  _unconditionally_ according to those
principles.
prompt:As for the two antinomies of the theoretical and practical employment
of the superior cognitive faculties  we have already shown their
_unavoidableness_  if judgement,completion:
prompt:And as for the antinomies in the employment of the Judgement  in
conformity with the requiremen,completion:ts of Reason  and their solution which
is here given  there are only two ways of avoiding them.
prompt:_Either_:
we must deny that any _a priori_ principle lies at the basis of the
aesthetical judgement of taste; we must maintain that all claim to
necessary universal agreement is a groundless and vain fancy  and that
a judgement of taste only deserves to be reg,completion:

this purposiveness  is not cognised empirically but _a priori_  it

noticeable a mere _subjective_ purposiveness in the free play of our,completion:

not regard as a ground of the possibility of such a shape the sand  or
the neighbouring sea  or the winds  or beasts with familiar footprints

such a concept  which is only possible through Reason  would seem so
infinitely great  that it would be just as if there were no natural

merely extend to the possibility of an object) and sensible intuitions
(which,completion: give us something without allowing us to cognise it thus as an

between the merely possible and the actual rests on this  that the
former only signifies the positing of the representation of a thin,completion:g

of thought; while the latter signifies the positing of the thing in
itself [outside this concept].
prompt:[117] The distinction  then  of possible
things from actual is one which has merely subjective validity for the
human Understanding  because we ,completion:can always have a thing in our thoughts
although it is [really] nothing  or we can represent a thing as given
although we have no concept of it.
prompt:The propositions therefore--that
things can be possible without being actual  and that consequently no
conclusion can be drawn as to act,completion:uality from mere possibility--are
quite valid for human Reason  without thereby proving that this
distinction lies in things themselves.
prompt:That this does not follow  and
that consequently these propositions  though valid of Objects (in
so far as our cognitive faculty  as sensuously conditioned  busies
itself with Objects of sense)  do not hold for things in general 
appears from the irrepressible demand of Reason to assume ,completion:something
(the original ground) necessarily existing as unconditioned  in which
possibility and actuality should no longer be distinguished  and
for which Idea our Understanding has absolutely no concept; _i.e._
it can find no way of representing such a thing and its manner of
existence.

may ,completion:do at pleasure)  the thing is merely represented as possible.

I cannot presuppose in every such being thought and intuition as two

say: All Objects that I know _are_  _i.e._ exist; and the possibility
of some  which yet ,completion:do not exist (_i.e._ the contingency or the
contrasted necessity of those which do exist)  might never come into
the representation of such a being at all.

for our Understanding to treat its concepts here as Reason does  is
merely that for it  as human Understanding  that is transcendent

the possibility,completion: of things that we can make intelligible to ourselves
according to purposes; but it cannot determine this concept further 
either in a theoretical or a practical point of view.
prompt:Its endeavour
does not come up to its design of being the basis of a Theology  but
it always remains only a physical Teleology; because the purposive
reference therein is and must be always considered only as conditioned
in nature  and it consequently cannot inquire into the p,completion:urpose for

prompt:For if they considered the arrangement and the course of things in
nature  they certainly found ground enough for assuming something
more than mechanism as,completion: its cause  and for conjecturing behind the
machinery of this world designs of certain higher causes  which they
could not think otherwise than superhuman.

good and evil  the purposive and the unpurposive  mingled together (at
least as far as our insight goes)  and could not permit themselves
to assume nevertheless that wise and benevolent purposes of which
they saw no proof lay hidden at b,completion:ottom  on behalf of the arbitrary
Idea of a supremely perfect original Author  their judgement upon
the supreme World Cause could hardly have been other than it was  so
long as they proceeded consistently according to maxims of the mere
theoretical use of Reason.
prompt:Others  who wished to be theologians as
well as physicists  thought to find contentment for the Reason by
providing for the absolute unity of the pr,completion:inciple of natural things
which Reason demands  the Idea of a Being of which as sole Substance
the things would be all only inherent determinations.
prompt:This Substance
would not be Cause of the World by means of intelligence  bu,completion:
prompt:This
Being consequently would produce nothing according to purposes; but in
it all things  on account of the unity of the subject of ,completion:which they are
mere determinations  must necessarily relate themselves purposively to
one another  though without purpose and design.
prompt:Thus they introduced
the Idealism of final causes  by changing the unity (so difficult to
explain) of a number of purposive,completion:ly combined substances  from being
the unity of causal dependence _on one_ Substance to be the unity of
inherence _in one_.
prompt:This system--which in the sequel  considered on the
side of the inherent world beings  becomes _Pantheism_  and (later) on
the side of the Subject subsisting by itself as Original Being  becomes
_Spinozism_ --does not so much resolve as exp,completion:lain away into nothing the
question of the first ground of the purposiveness of nature; because
this latter concept  bereft of all reality  must be taken for a mere
misinterpretation of a universal ontological concept of a thing in
general.
prompt:Hence the concept of a Deity  which would be adequate for our
teleological judging of nature  can never be,completion: derived from mere
theoretical principles of the use of Reason (on which Physico-theology
alone is based).
prompt:For as one alternative we may explain all Teleology
as a mere deception of the Judgement in its judging of the causal
combination of things  and fly to the sole principle of a mere
me,completion:chanism of nature  which merely seems to us  on account of the unity
of the Substance of whose determinations nature is but the manifold 
to contain a universal reference to purposes.
prompt:Or if  instead of this
Idealism of final causes  we wish to remain attached to the principle
of the Realism of this pa,completion:rticular kind of causality  we may set
beneath natural purposes many intelligent original beings or only a
single one.
prompt:But so far as we have for the basis of this concept [of
Realism] only empirical principles derived from the actual purposive
combination in the world  we cannot on the one hand find any remedy for
the discordance that nature presents in many examples in respect of
unity ,completion:

prompt:What is the use  one might well complain  of placing at the
basis of all these arrangements a great Understanding incommensurable
b,completion:y us  and supposing it to govern the world according to design  if
nature does not and cannot tell us anything of the final design?
prompt:For
without this we cannot refer all these natural purposes to any common
point  nor can we form any teleological principle  sufficient either
for cognising the purposes collected,completion: in a system  or for forming a
concept of the Supreme Understanding  as Cause of such a nature  that
could serve as a standard for our Judgement reflecting teleologically
thereon.
prompt:I should thus have an _artistic Understanding_ for scattered
purposes  but no _Wisdom_ for a final purpos,completion:
prompt:But in the absence of a final purpose which pure Reason
alone can supply (because all purposes in the world are empirically
conditioned  and can contain nothing absolutely good but only what is
good for this or that regarded as a contingent design)  and which alone
would teach me what properties  what degree  and what relation of the
Supreme Cause to nature I have to thin,completion:k in order to judge of nature as
a teleological system; how and with what right do I dare to extend at
pleasure my very limited concept of that original Understanding (which
I can base on my limited knowledge of the world)  of the Might of that
original Being in actualising its Ideas  and of its Will to do so  and
complete this into the Idea of an Allwise  Infinite Being?
prompt:If this is
to be done theoretically  it would presuppose omniscience in me  in
order to see into the purposes of nature in their whole connexion  and
,completion:in addition the power of conceiving all possible plans  in comparison
with which the present plan would be judged on [sufficient] grounds
as the best.
prompt:For without this complete knowledge of the effect I can
arrive at no determinate concept of the Supreme Cause  which can only
be found in,completion: the concept of an Intelligence infinite in every respect 
_i.e._ the concept of a Deity  and so I can supply no foundation for
Theology.
prompt:Hence  with every possible extension of physical Teleology  according
to the propositions above laid down we may say: By the constitution
and the principles of our cognitive,completion: faculty we can think of nature  in
its purposive arrangements which have become known to us  in no other

is essentially ,completion:different in its principles from technically practical
Reason.
prompt:But we cannot assume that it must be so likewise in the supreme
World-Cause  regarded as Intelligence  and that a peculiar mo,completion:de of

constitution of our cognitive faculties; and whether we have to assume
His existence in order merely to furnish ,completion:practical reality to a

us _a priori_ to bring about with all our powers  _i.e._ in order to
be able to think as possible a designed effect.

predicates  whic,completion:h  although they are only possible from a supersensible

they make possible a cognition of a quite supersensible Being.--The
only concept of this kind to be met with in human Reason is that of the
freedom of men under moral laws  along with the final purpose which
Reason prescribes by these laws.
prompt:Of these two [the moral laws and the
final purpose] the first are useful for ascribing to the Author of
Nature  the second for ascribing to man  those properties which contain
the necessary condi,completion:tion of the possibility of both [God and the soul];

Religion has need).

which everything depends  whether we desire a theoretically adequate
concept of the Original Being on behalf of our whole knowledge of
nature  or a practical concept for religion.

produces a similar effect in the way of conviction upon the common
Understanding as upon the subtlest thinker; and a _Reimarus_[157] has
acquired immortal honour in his work (not y,completion:et superseded)  in which he
abundantly develops this ground of proof with his peculiar thoroughness
and lucidity.--But how does this proof acquire such mighty influence
upon the mind?

can give himself  as the condition under which alone he and his being

prompt:Failing this (which alone is susceptible
of a definite concept)  the purposes of nature do not satisfactorily
answer our questions; especially because they cannot furnish any
_determinate_,completion: concept of the highest Being as an all-sufficient (and
therefore unique and so properly called _highest_) being  and of the

its causality as that of a supreme _Understanding_  but to _cognise_
it by means of this determination of the said concept; because here
the troublesome ,completion:condition of space and of extension disappears.--At
all events the great purposiveness in the world compels us to _think_
a supreme cause of it  and to _think_ its causality as that of an
Understanding; but we are not therefore entitled to _ascribe_ this to
it.

concepts.

to the Supreme Being; for we have this concept only by drawing it from
our internal experience  and therefore from our depe,completion:ndence for

that properties w,completion:hich can yield a concept in concreto must be

the First Being  in which this Being is thought by the mere
ontological predicates of substance  of cause  etc.
prompt:This must be done 
because reason  actuated in the sensible world by mere conditions 
which are themselves always conditional  cannot otherwise have any
satisfaction  and it therefore can be done without falling into
anthropomorphism (which transfers,completion: predicates from the world of sense
to a Being quite distinct from the world)  because those predicates
are mere categories  which  though they do not give a determinate
concept of God  yet give a concept not limited to any conditions of
sensibility.

experience as one which bounds itself in the eye of our reason.

equitable  and in the (inevitably certain) event of its
non-,completion:performance  no assertion more just  than that hitherto
metaphysics has never existed as a science.
prompt:But there are two things which  in case the challenge be accepted  I
must deprecate: first  trifling about probability and conjecture 
which are suited as little to metaphysics ,completion: as to geometry; and
secondly  a decision by means of the magic wand of common sense  which
does not convince every one  but which accommodates itself to personal
peculiarities.

a philosophy ,completion:
prompt:Everything that is to be cognised a

judgments concerning the degree of the probability of certain cases 
under given,completion: uniform conditions  which  in the sum of all possible
cases  infallibly happen according to the rule  though it is not
sufficiently determined in respect to every single chance.

prompt:It is the faculty of the
knowledge and use of rules in concreto  as distinguished f,completion:
prompt:Common sense can hardly understand the rule   that every
event is determ,completion:ined by means of its cause   and can never comprehend
it thus generally.
prompt:It therefore demands an example from experience 
and when it hears that this rule means nothing but what it alwa,completion:ys
thought when a pane was broken or a kitchen-utensil missing  it then
understands the principle and grants it.
prompt:Common sense therefore is
only of use so far as it can see its rules (though they actually are a
priori) confirmed by experience; consequently to co,completion:mprehend them a
priori  or independently of experience  belongs to the speculative
understanding  and lies quite beyond the horizon of common sense.
prompt:But
the province of metaphysics is entirely confined to the latter kind of
knowledge  and it is certainly a bad index of common sense to appeal
to it as a witness  for,completion:
prompt:It is a common subterfuge of those false friends of common sense (who
occasionally prize it highly  but usually despise it) to say  that
there must surely be at all events some propositions wh,completion:ich are
immediately certain  and of which there is no occasion to give any
proof  or even any account at all  because we otherwise could never
stop inquiring into the grounds of our judgments.
prompt:But if we except the
principle of contradiction  which is not sufficient to show the truth
of synthetical judgments  they can never adduce  in proof of this
privilege  anything else ,completion:
prompt:But these judgments are radically d,completion:ifferent from those of
metaphysics.

whatever I represent to myself as possible by a concept: I add to the
first two the other two  one by one  and myself mak,completion:

(yet only in refere,completion:

concepts of mathematics  by (Ans,completion:chauung) visualising them  a priori 
and so show its possibility a priori.
prompt:This concept  together with the
principles of its application  always requires  if it shall hold a
priori—as is requisite in metaphysics—a justification ,completion:
prompt:Therefore in metaphysics  as a speculative science of pure reason  we
can never appeal to common sense  but may do so only when we are
forced to surrender it  and to renounce all purely speculative
cognition  which must always be know,completion:
prompt:For in this case the attitude o,completion:
prompt:Metaphysics must be science  not only as a whole  but in all
its parts  otherwise it is no,completion:thing; because  as a speculation of pure
reason  it finds a hold only on general opinions.

however  probability and common sense may be used with advantage and
justly  but on,completion: quite special principles  of which the importance
always depends on the reference to practical life.

ever to be attained  the present essay now before the public has a
fair tit,completion:le to an accurate and careful investigation  except it be
thought more advisable to give up all pretensions to metaphysics  to
which  if men but would consistently adhere to their purpose  no
objection can be made.

are two sorts of judgments: (1) one a judgment which precedes
investigation (in our case one in which the reader from h,completion:

researches that may be re,completion:pugnant to his formerly adopted metaphysics

be the case that there are a number of them  which  though among the

no ,completion:sure criterion of the truth of peculiarly metaphysical
(synthetical) propositions is to be met with in it  then the former
way of judging is not admissible  but the investigation of the
principles of the critique must precede all judgments as to its value.

in t,completion:he supplement to the third division  of January 19  1782 
pages 40 et seq.
prompt:When an author who is familiar with the subject of his work and
endeavors to present his independent reflexions in its elaboration 
falls into the hands of a reviewer who  in his turn  is keen enough to
discern the points on which the worth or worthlessness of the book
rests  who does not cling to words  but goes to the heart of the
subject  sifting and testing more than the mere principles which the
author takes as his point of departure,completion:
prompt:I find myself  with my review,completion:
prompt:He seems
not to see at all the real matter of the investigation ,completion:
prompt:It is either
impatience at thinking out a lengthy work  or vexation at a threatened
reform of a science in which he believed he had brought everything to
per,completion:fection long ago  or  what I am unwilling to imagine  real
narrowmindedness  that prevents him from ever carrying his thoughts
beyond his school-metaphysics.
prompt:In short  he passes impatiently in
review a long series of propositions  by which  without knowing their
premises  we can think nothing  intersperses here and there his
censure  the reason o,completion:f which the reader understands just as little as
the propositions against which it is directed; and hence [his report]
can neither serve the public nor damage me  in the judgment of
experts.
prompt:I should  for these reasons  have passed over this judgment
altogether  were it not that it may afford me occa,completion:sion for some
explanations which may in some cases save the readers of these
Prolegomena from a misconception.
prompt:In order to take a position from which my reviewer could most easily
set the whole work in a most unfavorable light  without venturing to
trouble himse,completion:lf with any special investigation  he begins and ends by
saying:

 This work is a system of transcendent (or  as he translates it  of
higher) Idealism.

A glance at this line soon showed me the sort of criticism that I had
to expect  much as though the reviewer were one who had never seen or

figures in turning over its leaves  were,completion:
prompt:Let us see  in the meantime  what sort of an idealism it is that goes
through my ,completion:whole work  although it does not by a long way constitute
the soul of the system.
prompt:The dictum of all genuine idealists from the Eleatic school to Bishop
Berkeley  is contained in this formula:  All cognition through,completion:
prompt:The principle that throughout dominates and determines my Idealism  is
on the contrary:  All cognition of things m,completion:erely from pure
understanding or pure reason is nothing but sheer illusion  and only
in experience is there truth.
prompt:But this is directly con,completion:

use this expression for quite an opposi,completion:te purpose  and how came my
reviewer to see it everywhere?
prompt:The solution of this difficulty rests on something that could have

prompt:Space and time  together with
all that they contain  are not things nor qualities in themselves  but
belong,completion: merely to the appearances of the latter: up to this point I am
one in confession with the above idealists.
prompt:But these  and amongst
them more particularly Berkeley  regarded space as a mere empirical
presentation that  like th,completion:e phenomenon it contains  is only known to
us by means of experience or perception  together with its
determinations.
prompt:I  on the contrary  prove in the first place  that
space (and also time  which Berkeley did not consider) and all its
determinations a priori  can be cognised by us  because  no,completion: less than
time  it inheres in our sensibility as a pure form before all
perception or experience and makes all intuition of the same  and
therefore all its phenomena  possible.
prompt:It follows from this  that as
truth rests on universal and necessary laws as its criteria 
experience  according to Berkeley  can have no criteria of truth 
because its phenomena (according to him) have nothing a priori at
their foundation; whence it follows  that they are no,completion:thing but sheer
illusion; whereas with us  space and time (in conjunction with the
pure conceptions of the understanding) prescribe their law to all
possible experience a priori  and at the same time afford the certain
criterion for distinguishing truth from illusion therein.
prompt:{46}

===================================
{46} Idealism proper always has a mystical tendency  and can have no
other  but mine is solely designed for the ,completion:
prompt:In this
way all mystical idealism falls to the ground  for (as may be seen
already in Plato) it inferred from our cognitions a priori (even from
those of geometry) anothe,completion:r intuition different from that of the senses
(namely  an intellectual intuition)  because it never occurred to any
one that the senses themselves might intuite a priori.
prompt:===================================

My so-called (properly critical) Idealism is of quite a special
character  in that it subverts the ordinary idealism  and that through
it all cogni,completion:tion a priori  even that of geometry  first receives
objective reality  which  without my demonstrated ideality of space
and time  could not be maintained by the most zealous realists.
prompt:This
being the state of the case  I could have wished  in order to avoid
all misunderstanding,completion:  to have named this conception of mine otherwise 
but to alter it altogether was impossible.
prompt:It may be permitted me
however  in future  as has been above intimated  to term it the
formal  or better still  the cri,completion:tical Idealism  to distinguish it from
the dogmatic Idealism of Berkeley  and from the sceptical Idealism of
Descartes.
prompt:Beyond this  I find nothing further r,completion:emarkable in the judgment of my
book.
prompt:The reviewer criticises here and there  makes sweeping
criticisms  a mode prudently chosen  since it does not betray one's
own knowledge or ignorance; a single thorough criticism,completion:
prompt:It was  moreover  not a badly conceived
plan  in order at once to take from readers (who are accustomed to
form their conceptions of books from newspaper reports) the desire to
read the book itself  to pour out in one breath a number of passages
in succession  torn from their connexion  and their grounds of proof
and explanations  and which must necessarily sound senseless 
espe,completion:cially considering how antipathetic they are to all
school-metaphysics; to exhaust the reader's patience ad nauseam  and
then  after having made me acquainted with the sensible proposition
that persistent illusion is truth  to conclude with the crude paternal
moralisation: to what end  then  the quarrel with accepted language 
to what end  and whence  the idealistic distinction?
prompt:A judgment which
seeks all that is characteristic of my book  first supposed to be
metaphysically heterodox  in a mere innovation of the,completion: nomenclature

sections of the doctrine of elements  as for instance in the deduction
of the conceptions of the Understanding  or in that on the paralogisms

the moral law in its purity and genuineness (and  in a practical

be any moral philosophy at all.

principles with the empirical does not deserve the name of

entirely new field.

particular kind- say one which should be determined solely from a

call a pure will  but volition in general  with all the actions and
conditions which belong to it in this general signification.

it is distinguished from a metaphysic of morals  just as general
logic  which treats of the acts and canons of thought i,completion:n general  is
distinguished from transcendental philosophy  which treats of the
particular acts and canons of pure thought  i.e.

prompt:It is in
this way they frame their notion of obligation  which  though anything

properly no other foundation for it than the critical examination of a
pure practical reason,completion:; just as that of metaphysics is the critical
examination of the pure speculative reason  already published.

in the first place the former is not so absolutely necessary as the
latter  because in moral concerns human reason can easily be brought
to a high degree of correctness and completeness  even in the
commonest understanding  while on the contrary in its theoretic but

application of the same principle to the whole system  and would be
greatly confirmed by the adequacy which it exhibits throughout; but
I must forego this advantage  which in,completion:deed would be after all more
gratifying than useful  since the easy applicability of a principle
and its apparent adequacy give no very certain proof of its soundness

prompt:Intelligence  wit  judgement  and the other talents of the mind 
however they may be named  or courage  resolution  perseverance  as
qualities of temperament  are undoubtedly good and desirable in ma,completion:ny
respects; but these gifts of nature may also become extremely bad
and mischievous if the will which is to make use of them  and which 
therefore  constitutes what is called character  is not good.

health  and the general well-being and contentment with one's
condition which is called happiness  inspire pride  and often

of acting and adapt it to its end.
prompt:The sight of a being who is not
adorned with a single feature of a pure and good will  e,completion:njoying
unbroken prosperity  can never give pleasure to an impartial
rational spectator.
prompt:Thus a good will appears to constitute the
indispe,completion:
prompt:There are even some qualities which are of service to this good will
itself and may facilitate its action  yet which have no intrinsic
unconditional valu,completion:
prompt:Moderation in the
affections and passions  self-control  and calm deliberation are not
only good in many respects  but even seem to constitute part of the
intrinsi,completion:c worth of the person; but they are far from deserving to be
called good without qualification  although they have been so
unconditionally praised by the ancients.
prompt:For without the principles of
a good will  they may become extremely bad  and the coolness of a
villain not only make,completion:s him far more dangerous  but also directly makes
him more abominable in our eyes than he would have been without it.
prompt:A good will is good not because of what it performs or effects 
not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end  but simply
by virtue of the volition; that is  it is good ,completion:
prompt:Even if it should happen that  owing to
special disfavour of fortune  or the niggardly provision of a
step-motherly nature  this will should wholly lack power to accomplish
its purpose  if with its greatest efforts it should yet achieve,completion:
nothing  and there should remain only the good will (not  to be
sure  a mere wish  but the summoning of all means in our power)  then 
like a jewel  it would still shine by its own light  as a thing
which has its whole value in itself.
prompt:Its usefulness or fruitlessness
can neither,completion:
prompt:It would be 
as it were  only the setting to enable us to handle it the more
conveniently in common commerce  or to attract to ,completion:
prompt:There is  however  something so strange in this idea of the absolute
value of the mere will  in which no account is taken of its utility 
that notwithstanding the thorough assent of even common reason to
the,completion: idea  yet a suspicion must arise that it may perhaps really be the
product of mere high-flown fancy  and that we may have misunderstood
the purpose of nature in assigning reason as the governor of our will.
prompt:Therefore we will examine this,completion: idea from this point of view.
prompt:In the physical constitution of an organized being  that is  a being
adapted suitably to the purposes of life  we assume it as a
,completion:fundamental principle that no organ for any purpose will be found
but what is also the fittest and best adapted for that purpose.
prompt:Now in
a being which has reason and a will  if the proper object of nature
were its conservation  its welfare  in a word  its hap,completion:piness  then
nature would have hit upon a very bad arrangement in selecting the
reason of the creature to carry out this purpose.
prompt:For all the
actions which the creature has to perform with a view to this purpose 
and the whole rule of its conduct  would be far mor,completion:
prompt:Should reason
have been communicated to this favoured creature over and above  it
must only have served it to contemplate the happy constitution of
its nature  to admire it  to congratulate its,completion:elf thereon  and to
feel thankful for it to the beneficent cause  but not that it should
subject its desires to that weak and delusive guidance and meddle
bunglingly with the purpose of nature.
prompt:In a word  nature would have
taken care that reason should not break forth into practical exercise 
nor have the p,completion:
prompt:Nature
would not only have taken on herself the choice of the ends  but
also,completion:
prompt:And  in fact  we find that the more a cultivated reason applies
itself with deliberate purpose ,completion:
prompt:And from this
circumstance there arises in many  if they are candid enough to
confess it  a certain degree of misology  that is  hatred of reason 
especially in the case of those who are most experienced in the use of
it  because after calculating all the advantages they derive  I do not
say from the invention of all the arts of common luxury  but even from
the sciences (,completion:which seem to them to be after all only a luxury of
the understanding)  they find that they have  in fact  only brought
more trouble on their shoulders  rather than gained in happiness;
and they end by envying  rather than despising  the more common
stamp of men who keep closer to the guidance of mere instinct and do
not allow their reason much influence on their conduct.
prompt:And this we
must admit  that the judgement of those who would very much lower
the lofty eulogies of the advantages which reason gives us in regard
to the happiness and satisfaction of life  or who would even reduce
them below zero  is by no means morose or ungrateful to the goodness
with which the world is governed,completion:  but that there lies at the root of
these judgements the idea that our existence has a different and far
nobler end  for which  and not for happiness  reason is properly
intended  and which must  therefore  be regarded as the supreme
condition to which the private ends of man must  for the most part  be
postponed.
prompt:For as reason is not competent to guide the will with certainty in
regard to its objects and the satisfaction of all our wants (which
it to some extent even multiplies)  ,completion:
prompt:as one which is to have influence on the will 
therefore  admitting that nature generally in the distribution of
her capacities has adapted the means to the en,completion:d  its true
destination must be to produce a will  not merely good as a means to
something else  but good in itself  for which reason was absolutely
necessary.
prompt:This will then  though not indeed the sole and complete
good  must be the su,completion:
prompt:Under these circumstances  there is
nothing inconsistent with the wisdom of nature in the fact that the
cultivation of the reason  which is requisite for the firs,completion:
prompt:Nay  it may even reduce it to nothing 
wit,completion:
prompt:For reason recognizes
the establishment of a good will as its highest practical destination 
and in attaining this purpose is capable only of a satisfaction of its
own proper kin,completion:
prompt:We have then to develop the notion of a will which deserves to be
highly esteemed for itself and is good without a view to anything
further  a notion which exists already in the sound natural
,completion:understanding  requiring rather to be cleared up than to be taught 
and which in estimating the value of our actions always takes the
first place and constitutes the condition of all the rest.
prompt:In order to
do this  we will take the notion of duty  which includes that of ,completion:
prompt:These  however  far from concealing it  or rendering it
unrecognizable  ra,completion:
prompt:I omit here all actions which are already recognized as inconsistent
with duty  although they may be useful for this or that,completion: purpose  for
with these the question whether they are done from duty cannot arise
at all  since they even conflict with it.
prompt:I also set aside those
actions which really conform to duty  but to which men have no
direc,completion:t inclination  performing them because they are impelled
thereto by some other inclination.
prompt:For in this case we can readily
distinguish whether the action w,completion:hich agrees with duty is done from
duty  or from a selfish view.
prompt:It is much harder to make this
distinction when the action accords,completion: with duty and the subject has
besides a direct inclination to it.
prompt:For example  it is always a matter
of duty that a dealer should not over charge an inexperienced
purchaser; and wherever there is much co,completion:mmerce the prudent tradesman
does not overcharge  but keeps a fixed price for everyone  so that a
child buys of him as well as any other.
prompt:Men are thus honestly
served; but this is not enough to make us believe that the tradesman
has so acted from duty and from principles of honesty: his own
advantage required it; it is out of,completion:
prompt:Accordingly the action was done neither from duty
nor f,completion:rom direct inclination  but merely with a selfish view.
prompt:On the other hand  it is a duty to maintain one's life; and  ,completion:in
addition  everyone has also a direct inclination to do so.
prompt:But on this
account the often anxious care which most men take fo,completion:r it has no
intrinsic worth  and their maxim has no moral import.
prompt:They preserve
their life as duty requires,completion:
prompt:On the other hand  if adversity and hopeless sorrow have
completely taken away the relish for life; if the unfortunate one 
strong in mind  indignant at his fate rather t,completion:han desponding or
dejected  wishes for death  and yet preserves his life without
loving it- not from inclination or fear  but from duty- then his maxim
has a moral worth.
prompt:To be beneficent when we can is a duty; and besides this  there
are many minds so sympathetically constituted that  without any
other motive of vanity,completion:
prompt:But I maintain that in
such a case an action of this kind  however proper  however amiable it,completion:
prompt:the inclination to honour  which  if it is
happily directed to that which is in fact of public utility ,completion:and
accordant with duty and consequently honourable  deserves praise and
encouragement  but not esteem.
prompt:For the maxim lacks the moral import 
namely  that s,completion:uch actions be done from duty  not from inclination.
prompt:Put
the case that the mind of that philanthropist were clouded by sorrow
of his own  extinguishing all sympathy with the lot of others  and
that  while he still has the power to benefit others in distress  he
is not touched by their trou,completion:
prompt:Further still; if nature has put little sympathy in the
heart of this or that man; if he  supposed to be an upright man  is by
temperament cold and indifferent to the sufferings of others 
perhaps because in respect of his own he is provided with the
special gift of patience and fortitude and supposes  or even req,completion:uires 
that others should have the same- and such a man would certainly not
be the meanest product of nature- but if nature had not specially
framed him for a philanthropist  would he not still find in himself
a source from whence to give himself a far higher worth than that of a
good-natured temperament could be?
prompt:Unquest,completion:
prompt:It is just in
this that the moral worth of the character is brought out which is
incompara,completion:
prompt:To secure one's own happiness is a duty  at least indirectly; for
discontent with one's condition  under a pressur,completion:e of many anxieties
and amidst unsatisfied wants  might easily become a great temptation
to transgression of duty.
prompt:But here again  without looking to duty  all
men have already the strongest and most intimate inclin,completion:ation to
happiness  because it is just in this idea that all inclinations are
combined in one total.
prompt:But the precept of happiness is often of such a
sort that it greatly interferes with some inclinations  and yet a
man,completion: cannot form any definite and certain conception of the sum of
satisfaction of all of them which is called happiness.
prompt:It is not
then to be wondered at that a single inclination  definite both as
to what it promises and as to the time within which it can be
gratified  is often able to overcome such a fluctuating idea  and that
a gouty patient  for instance  can choose to en,completion:
prompt:But even in this case  if the
general desire for happiness did not influence his will  and supposing
that in his particular case health was not a necessary element in this
calculation  there ye,completion:
prompt:It is in this manner  undoubtedly  that we are to understand those
passages of ,completion:Scripture also in which we are commanded to love our
neighbour  even our enemy.
prompt:For love  as an affection  cannot be
commanded  but beneficence for duty's sake may; even though we are,completion: not
impelled to it by any inclination- nay  are even repelled by a natural
and unconquerable aversion.
prompt:This is practical love and not
pathological- a love which is seated in the will  and not in the
propensions o,completion:
prompt:The second proposition is: That an action done from duty derives its
moral worth  not from the purpose which is to be attained by it  but
from the maxim by which it is determined  and the,completion:refore does not
depend on the realization of the object of the action  but merely on
the principle of volition by which the action has taken place  without
regard to any object of desire.
prompt:It is clear from what precedes that
the purposes which we may have in view in our actions  or their
eff,completion:ects regarded as ends and springs of the will  cannot give to
actions any unconditional or moral worth.
prompt:In what  then  can their
worth lie  if it is not to cons,completion:ist in the will and in reference to its
expected effect?
prompt:It cannot lie anywhere but in the principle of the
will wit,completion:
prompt:For the will stands between its a priori principle  which is formal 
and its a posteriori spring  which is material  as between two roads 
and as it must be determined by somethi,completion:ng  it follows that it must be
determined by the formal principle of volition when an action is done
from duty  in which case every material principle has been withdrawn
from it.

interest.
prompt:It is only what is connected with my will as a principle  by
no means as an effect- what does not subserve my inclination  but

anthropology  theology  physics  or hyperphysics  and still less
with occult qualities (which we might call hypophysical)  ,completion:
prompt:For the pure
conception of duty  unmixed with any foreign addition of empirical
attractions  and  in a word  the conception of the moral law 
exercises on the human heart  by way of reason alone (which first

understanding shows that if we imagine  on the one hand  an act of

temptations of necessity or all,completion:urement  and  on the other hand  a
similar act which was affected  in however low a degree  by a
foreign motive  the former leaves far behind and eclipses the
second; it elevates the soul and inspires the wish to be able to act
in like manner oneself.
prompt:Even moderately young children feel this
impression  ana on,completion:e should never represent duties to them in any other
light.
prompt:From what has been said  it is clear that all moral conceptions have
their seat and origin completely a priori in the reason  and that 
moreover  in the commonest reason just as truly as in that which is in
the highest degree speculative; that they cannot be obtained by
abstraction from any empirical  and therefore merely contingent 
knowledge; that it is just this purity of their origin that makes them
worthy to serve as our supreme practical pri,completion:nciple  and that just in
proportion as we add anything empirical  we detract from their genuine
influence and from the absolute value of actions; that it is not
only of the greatest necessity  in a purely speculative point of view 
but is also of the greatest practical importance  to derive these
notions and laws from pure reason  to present them pure and unmixed 
and even to determine the compass of this practical or pure rational
knowledge  i.e.
prompt:to determine the whole faculty of pure practical
reason; and  in doing so  we must not make its principles dependent on
the particular nature of human reason  though in speculative
philosophy ,completion:this may be permitted  or may even at times be necessary;
but since moral laws ought to hold good for every rational creature 
we must derive them from the general concept of a rational being.
prompt:In
this way  although for its application to man morality has need of
anthropology ,completion:
prompt:as metaphysic  complete in
itself (a thing which in such distinct branches of science is easily
done); knowing well that unless we are in possession of this  it would
not only be vain to determine the moral element of duty in right
actions for purposes of speculative criticism ,completion: but it would be
impossible to base morals on their genuine principles  even for common
practical purposes  especially of moral instruction  so as to
produce pure moral dispositions  and to engraft them on men's minds to
the promotion of the greatest possible good in the world.
prompt:But in order that in this study we may not merely advance by the
natural steps from the common moral judgement (in this case very
worthy of respect) to the philosophical  as has been already done  but
also from a popular philosophy  which goes no further than it can
reach by groping with the help of examples  to metaphysic (which
does allow itse,completion:lf to be checked by anything empirical and  as it
must measure the whole extent of this kind of rational knowledge  goes
as far as ideal conceptions  where even examples fail us)  we must
follow and clearly describe the practical faculty of reason  from
the general rules of its determination to the point where the notion
of duty springs from it.

objectively necessary are subjectively necessary also  i.e.
prompt:the
will is a faculty to choose that only which reason indepe,completion:
prompt:as g,completion:ood.
prompt:But if
reason of itself does not sufficiently determine the will  if the
latter is subject also to subjective conditions (particular
impulses) which do not always coincide with the objective
conditions; in a word  if the will does not in itself completely
accord with reason (which is actually the case with men)  then the
actions which objectively are recognised a,completion:s necessary are subjectively
contingent  and the determination of such a will according to
objective laws is obligation  that is to say  the relation of the
objective laws to a will that is not thoroughly good is conceived as
the determination of the will of a rational being by principles of
reason  but which the will from its nature does not of necessity
follow.
prompt:The conception of an objective principle  in so far as it is
obligatory for a will  is,completion: called a command (of reason)  and the
formula of the command is called an imperative.
prompt:All imperatives are expressed by the word ought [or shall]  and
thereby indicate the relation of an objective law,completion: of reason to a will 
which from its subjective constitution is not necessarily determined
by it (an obligation).

prompt:Since every practical law represents a possible action as good
and  on this account  for a subject who is practically determinable by
reason ,completion: necessary  all imperatives are formulae determining an
action which is necessary according to the principle of a will good in
some respects.
prompt:If now the action is good only as a means to
something else  then the imperative is hypothetical; if it is
conceived as good in ,completion:itself and consequently as being necessarily
the principle of a will which of itself conforms to reason  then it is
categorical.
prompt:Thus the imperative declares what action possible by me would be
good and presents the practical rule in relation to a will which
does not forthwith perform an action simply because it is,completion: good 
whether because the subject does not always know that it is good  or
because  even if it know this  yet its maxims might be opposed to
the objective principles of practical reason.

condition  and as being absolutely  although practically  necessary 
may be quite properly called a command.
prompt:We might also call the first
kind of imperatives technical (belonging to art)  the second

prompt:Now arises the question  how are,completion: all these imperatives possible?
prompt:This question does not seek to know how we can conceive the
accomplishment of the action which the imper,completion:ative ordains  but
merely how we can conceive the obligation of the will which the
imperative expresses.
prompt:No special explanation is needed to show,completion: how
an imperative of skill is possible.
prompt:Whoever wills the end  wills

which are indispensably necessary thereto.

prompt:If it were only equally easy to give a definite conception of
happiness  the imperatives o,completion:f prudence would correspond exactly with
those of skill  and would likewise be analytical.
prompt:For in this case
as in that  it could be said:  Whoever wills the end  wills also
(according ,completion:to the dictate of reason necessarily) the indispensable
means thereto which are in his power.
prompt:But  unfortunately  the
notion of happiness is so indefinite that although every man wishes to
atta,completion:in it  yet he never can say definitely and consistently what it is
that he really wishes and wills.
prompt:The reason of this is that all the
elements which belong ,completion:to the notion of happiness are altogether
empirical  i.e.
prompt:they must be borrowed from experience  and
nevertheless the idea of happiness require,completion:s an absolute whole  a
maximum of welfare in my present and all future circumstances.
prompt:Now
it is impossible that the most clear-sighted and at the same time most

counsels  e.g.

prompt:which

prompt:Hence it follows that the imperatives of prudence do not  strictly
speaking  command at all  that is  they cannot present actions
objectively as practically necessary; that they are rather to be
regarded as counsels (consilia) than precepts precepts of reason  that
the problem to determine certainly and universally what action would
promote the happiness of a rational being is completel,completion:y insoluble  and
consequently no imperative respecting it is possible which should 
in the strict sense  command to do what makes happy; because happiness
is not an ideal of reason but of imagination  resting solely on
empirical grounds  and it is vain to expect that these should define
an action by which one could attain the totality of a series of
consequences which is really endless.
prompt:This imperative of prudence
would however be an analytical proposition if we assume that the means
to happiness could be certainly assigned; for it is distinguished from
the imperative of skill only by this  that in the latter the end is
merely p,completion:ossible  in the former it is given; as however both only
ordain the means to that which we suppose to be willed as an end  it
follows that the imperative which ordains the willing of the means
to him who wills the end is in both cases analytical.
prompt:Thus there is no
difficulty in regard to the po,completion:ssibility of an imperative of this
kind either.
prompt:On the other hand  the question how the imperative of morality is
possible  is undoubtedly one  the only one  demanding a solution  as
this is not ,completion:at all hypothetical  and the objective necessity which
it presents cannot rest on any hypothesis  as is the case with the
hypothetical imperatives.
prompt:Only here we must never leave out of
consideration that we cannot make out by any example  in other words
empirically  whether there is,completion:

that it should mean:  Thou shalt not make a lying promise  lest if
it become known thou shouldst destroy thy credit   bu,completion:

its reali,completion:ty being given in experience  so that [the elucidation of]
its possibility should be requisite only for its explanation  not
for its establishment.

beforehand that the categorical imperative alone has the purport of
a practical law; all the rest may indeed be called principles of the

talks of sympath,completion:y and good-will  or even takes care occasionally to
put it into practice  but  on the other side  also cheats when he can 
betrays the rights of men  or otherwise violates them.
prompt:But although it
is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance
with that maxim ,completion:
prompt:For a will which
resolved this would contradict itself  inasmuch as many cases might
occur in which one would have need of the love and symp,completion:athy of others 
and in which  by such a law of nature  sprung from his own will  he
would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires.
prompt:These are a few of the many actual duties  or at least what we
regard as such  w,completion:
prompt:We must be able to will that a maxim

moral app,completion:reciation of the action generally.
prompt:Some actions are of such a
character that their maxim cannot without contradiction be even

impossibility is not found  but still it is impossible to will that
their maxim should be raised to the universality of a law of nature

duty  we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim

if we considered all cases from one and the same point of view 
namely  that of reason  we should find a contradiction in our own
will  nam,completion:ely  that a certain principle should be objectively necessary
as a universal law  and yet subjectively should not be universal 
but admit of exceptions.
prompt:As however we at one moment regard our action
from the point of view of a will wholly conformed to reason  and
then again look at the same action from the point of view of a will
affected by inclination  there is not really a,completion:
prompt:Now  although this cannot be justified in our own impartial
judgement  yet it proves that we do really recognise the validity of

conception which is to have any import and real legis,completion:

great importance  exhibited clearly and definitely for every practical
application the c,completion:
prompt:We have not yet  however  advanced so far as to prove a priori that
there actually is such an imperative  that there is a p,completion:ractical law
which commands absolutely of itself and without any other impulse  and
that the following of this law is duty.
prompt:With the view of attaining to this  it is of extreme importance to
remember that we must not allow ours,completion:
prompt:For duty is to be a practical  unconditional necessity of
action; it must therefore hold for all rational b,completion:eings (to whom an
imperative can apply at all)  and for this reason only be also a law
for all human wills.
prompt:On the contrary  whatever is deduced from the
particular natural characteristics of humanity  from certain
feelings and propensions  nay  even  if possible  from any
particular tendency proper to human reason  and which need not
necessarily hold for the will of every rational being; this may indee,completion:d
supply us with a maxim  but not with a law; with a subjective
principle on which we may have a propension and inclination to act 
but not with an objective principle on which we should be enjoined
to act  even though all our propensions  inclinations  and natural
dispositions were opposed to it.
prompt:In fact  the sublimity and
intrinsic dignity of the command in duty are so much the more evident 
the less the subjective impulses favour ,completion:
prompt:Here then we see philosophy brought to a critical position  since it
has to be fi,completion:rmly fixed  notwithstanding that it has nothing to support
it in heaven or earth.
prompt:Here it must show its purity as absolute
director of its own laws  not the herald of t,completion:
prompt:Although these may be better than nothing  yet they can
never afford principles dictated by reason  which must have their
source wholly a priori and thence their commanding auth,completion:
prompt:Thus every empirical element is not only quite incapable of being an
aid to the principle of morality  but is even highly prejudicial to
the purity of morals  for the proper and in,completion:estimable worth of an
absolutely good will consists just in this  that the principle of
action is free from all influence of contingent grounds  which alone
experience can furnish.
prompt:We cannot too much or too often repeat our
warning against this lax and even mean habit of thought which seeks
for its principle amongst empirical motives and laws; for human reason
in its weariness is glad to rest on this pillow  and in a dream of
sweet illu,completion:sions (in which  instead of Juno  it embraces a cloud) it
substitutes for morality a bastard patched up from limbs of various
derivation  which looks like anything one chooses to see in it  only
not like virtue to one who has once beheld her in her true form.
prompt:*



* To behold virtue in her proper form is nothing else but to
contemplate morality stripp,completion:ed of all admixture of sensible things
and of every spurious ornament of reward or self-love.
prompt:How much she
then eclipses everything else that appears charming to the affections 
every one may r,completion:eadily perceive with the least exertion of his
reason  if it be not wholly spoiled for abstraction.
prompt:The question then is this:  Is it a necessary law for all rational
beings that they should always judge,completion: of their actions by maxims of
which they can themselves will that they should serve as universal
laws?
prompt:If it is so  then it must be connected (altogether a priori)
wit,completion:h the very conception of the will of a rational being generally.
prompt:But in order to discover this connexion we must  however
reluctantly  take a step into metaphysic  altho,completion:ugh into a domain of it
which is distinct from speculative philosophy  namely  the
metaphysic of morals.
prompt:In a practical philosophy  where it is not the
reasons of what happens that we have ,completion:
prompt:objective
practical laws  there it is not necessary to inquire into the
reasons why anything pleases or displeases  how the pleasure of mere
sensation differs from taste  and whether the latter is distinct
from a general satisfaction of reason; on what the feeling of pleasure
or pain rests  an,completion:
prompt:But here we are
concerned with objective practical laws and  consequently  with the
relation of the will to itself so far as it is determined by reason
alone  in which case whatever has reference to a,completion:nything empirical is
necessarily excluded; since if reason of itself alone determines the
conduct (and it is the possibility of this that we are now
investigating)  it must necessarily do so a priori.
prompt:The will is conceived as a faculty of determining oneself t,completion:o
action in accordance with the conception of certain laws.
prompt:And such a
faculty can be fo,completion:und only in rational beings.
prompt:Now that which serves
the will as the objective ground of its self-determination is th,completion:e end 
and  if this is assigned by reason alone  it must hold for all
rational beings.
prompt:On the other hand  that which merely contains the
ground of possibility,completion:
prompt:The subjective ground of the desire is the
spring  the objective ground of the volition is the motive; hence
the distinctio,completion:n between subjective ends which rest on springs  and
objective ends which depend on motives valid for every rational being.
prompt:Practical principles are formal when they abstract from all subjective
ends; they,completion: are material when they assume these  and therefore
particular springs of action.
prompt:The ends which a rational being proposes
to himself at pleasure as effects of his actions (material ends) are
all only relative  for it is only their relation to the particular
desires o,completion:
prompt:Hence
all these relative ends can give,completion:
prompt:Supposing  however  that there were something whose existence has in
itself an absolute worth  something which  being an end in its,completion:

prompt:Now I say: man and generally any rational being exists as an end
in himself  not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or
that,completion: will  but in all his actions  whether they concern himself or
other rational beings  must be always regarded at the same time as
an end.
prompt:All objects of the inclinations have only a conditional worth 
for if the inclinations,completion:
prompt:But the inclinations 
themselves being sources of want  are so far from having an absolute
worth for which they shou,completion:
prompt:Thus the worth of any object which is to be ,completion:
prompt:Beings whose existence depends not on
our will but on nature's  have nevertheless  if they are irrational
beings  only a relative value as means  and are therefore called
things; rational beings  on the contrary  are ca,completion:lled persons 
because their very nature points them out as ends in themselves 
that is as something which must not be used merely as means  and so
far therefore restricts freedom of action (and is an object of
respect).
prompt:These  therefore  are not merely subjective ends whose
existence has a worth for us as an effect of our action  but objective
ends  that is  things whose existence is an end in itself; an end
moreover for which no other can be substitute,completion:
prompt:If then there is a supreme practical principle or  in respect of the
human will  a categorical imperative  it must be one which  being
drawn from the conception of that ,completion:
prompt:The foundation of this principle is: rat,completion:ional nature exists as an
end in itself.
prompt:Man necessarily conceives his own existence as being
so; s,completion:
prompt:But
every other rational being regards its existence similarly  just on
the same rational principle that holds for me: * so that it is,completion: at the
same time an objective principle  from which as a supreme practical
law all laws of the will must be capable of being deduced.
prompt:Accordingly
the practical imperative will be as follows: So act as to treat
humanity  whether i,completion:

inquire whether this,completion: can be practically carried out.
prompt:* This proposition is he,completion:

Firstly  under the head of necessary duty to oneself: He who
contemplates ,completion:suicide should ask himself whether his action can be
consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself.
prompt:If he
destroys himself in order to escape from painful circumstances  he
uses a ,completion:person merely as a mean to maintain a tolerable condition up to
the end of life.

the rights of men intends to use the person of others merely as a
means  without considering that as rationa,completion:
prompt:*



* Let it not be thought that the,completion:
prompt:could serve here as t,completion:he rule or principle.
prompt:For it is only a
deduction from the former  though with several limitations; it
cannot be a universal law  for it does not contain the principle of
duties to oneself  nor of the duties of benevolence to others (for
many a one would gladly consent that other,completion:s should not benefit him 
provided only that he might be excused from showing benevolence to
them)  nor finally that of duties of strict obligation to one another 
for on this principle the criminal might argue against the judge who
punishes him  and so on.

is not enough that the action,completion:

anything from it; but after al,completion:
prompt:For the ends of any subject which is an end in himself ought
as far as possib,completion:le to be my ends also  if that conception is to have
its full effect with me.
prompt:This principle  that humanity and generally every rational nature is
an end in itself (which is the supreme limiting condition of every
man's freedom of action)  is not borrowed from experience  firstly 
because it is universal  applying as it does to all rational beings
whatever  and experience is not capable of determining anything
about ,completion:
prompt:In fact the objective principle of all practical legislation
lies (according to the first principle) in the rule and its form of
universality which makes it capable of being a law (sa,completion:y  e. g.  a
law of nature); but the subjective principle is in the end; now by the
second principle the subject of all ends is each rational being 
inasmuch as it is an end in itself.
prompt:Hence follows the third
practical principle of the will  which is the ,completion:
prompt:: the idea of the
will of every rational,completion:
prompt:On this principle all maxims are rejected which are inco,completion:
prompt:Thus the will is
not subject simply to the law  but so subject that it must be regarded
as itself givi,completion:ng the law and  on this ground only  subject to the
law (of which it can regard itself as the author).
prompt:In the previous imperatives  namely  that based on the conception of
the conformity of actions to general laws  as in a physical system
of nature  and that based on the universal prerogative of rational
beings as ends in themselves- these imperatives  just becau,completion:se they
were conceived as categorical  excluded from any share in their
authority all admixture of any interest as a spring of action; they
were  however  only assumed to be categorical  because such an
assumption was necessary to explain the conception of duty.
prompt:But we
could not prove independently that there are practical propositions
which command categorically  nor can it be proved in this section; one
thing  however  could be done  namely  to indicate in the imp,completion:
prompt:This is
done in the present (third) formula of the principle  namely  in the,completion:
idea of the will of every rational being as a universally
legislating will.
prompt:For although a will which is subject to laws may be attached to this
law by means of an interest  yet a will which is itself a supreme
lawgiver so far as it is such cannot possibly de,completion:
prompt:Thus the principle that every human will is a will which in all
its maxims gives universal laws  * provided it be otherwise
justified  would be very well adapted to be the categorical
impera,completion:tive  in this respect  namely  that just because of the idea
of universal legislation it is not based on interest  and therefore it
alone among all possible imperatives can be unconditional.

better  converting the proposition,completion:

can only command that everything be done from maxims of one's will
regarded as a will which could at the same time will that it ,completion:
prompt:* I may be excused from adducing examples to elucidate this
principle  as those which have already been,completion:
prompt:Looking back now on all previous attempts to discover the
pr,completion:inciple of morality  we need not wonder why they all failed.
prompt:It
was seen that man was bound to laws by duty  but it was not observed
that the laws to which he is subject are only those of his own giving 
though at the sam,completion:
prompt:For when one has
conceived man only as subject to a law (no matter what)  then this law
required some interest  either by way of attraction or constra,completion:int 
since it did not originate as a law from his own will  but this will
was according to a law obliged by something else to act in a certain
manner.
prompt:Now by this necessary consequence all the labour spent in,completion:
prompt:For men
never elicited duty  but only a ne,completion:cessity of acting from a certain
interest.
prompt:Whether this interest was private or otherwise  in any
case the imperative must,completion: be conditional and could not by any means
be capable of being a moral command.
prompt:I will therefore call this the
principle of autonomy of the will  in,completion: contrast with every other
which I accordingly reckon as heteronomy.
prompt:The conception of the will of every rational being as one which must
consider itself as giving in all the maxims of its will universal
laws  so as to judge ,completion:itself and its actions from this point of view-
this conception leads to another which depends on it and is very
fruitful  namely that of a kingdom of ends.
prompt:By a kingdom I understand the union of differe,completion:nt rational beings
in a system by common laws.
prompt:Now since it is by laws that ends are
determined as regards their universal validity  hence  if we
abstract from the personal differences of rational beings and likewise
from all the content of their private ends  we shall be able to
conceive all e,completion:
prompt:For all rational beings come under the law that each of them must
treat itself and all ,completion:others never merely as means  but in every case
at the same time as ends in themselves.
prompt:Hence results a systematic
union of rati,completion:
prompt:a kingdom
which may be called a kingdom of ends  since what these laws have i,completion:n
view is just the relation of these beings to one another as ends and
means.
prompt:It is certainly,completion: only an ideal.
prompt:A rational being belongs as a member to the kingdom of ends when 
althou,completion:
prompt:He belongs to it as sovereign when  while giving ,completion:laws 
he is not subject to the will of any other.
prompt:A rational being must always regard himself as giving laws either as
member or as,completion:
prompt:He cannot  however  maintain the latter
position merely by the maxims of his will  but only in case ,completion:he is a
completely independent being without wants and with unrestricted power
adequate to his will.
prompt:Morality consists then in the reference of all action to the
,completion:
prompt:This
legislation must be capable of existing in every rational being and of
emanating from his will  so that the principle of this will is never
to act on any maxim which could,completion: not without contradiction be also a
universal law and  accordingly  always so to act that the will could
at the same time regard itself as giving in its maxims universal laws.
prompt:If now the maxims of rational beings are not by their own nature
coincident with this obje,completion:
prompt:du,completion:
prompt:Duty does not
apply to the sovereign in the kingdom of ends  b,completion:
prompt:The practical necessity of a,completion:
prompt:duty 
does not rest at all on feelings  impulses  or inclinations  but
solely on the relation of rational beings to one another  a relation
,completion:in which the will of a rational being must always be regarded as
legislative  since otherwise it could not be conceived as an end in
itself.
prompt:Reason then refers every maxim of the will  regarding it as
legislating universally  to every other will and also to every
action towards oneself; and this not on acc,completion:ount of any other practical
motive or any future advantage  but from the idea of the dignity of
a rational being  obeying no law but that which he himself also gives.
prompt:In the kingdom of ends everythi,completion:ng has either value or dignity.
prompt:Whatever has a value can be replaced by something else which is
equivalent; whatever  on ,completion:the other hand  is above all value  and
therefore admits of no equivalent  has a dignity.
prompt:Whatever has reference to the general inclinations and wants of
mankind has a market value; whatever  without presupposing a want 
corresponds to a certain taste  that is to a satisfaction in the,completion:
mere purposeless play of our faculties  has a fancy value; but that
which constitutes the condition under which alone anything can be an
end in itself  this has not merely a relative worth  i.e.
prompt:value 
but an intrinsic ,completion:worth  that is  dignity.
prompt:Now morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can
be an end in himself  sin,completion:ce by this alone is it possible that he
should be a legislating member in the kingdom of ends.
prompt:Thus
morality  and humanity as capable ,completion:of it  is that which alone has
dignity.
prompt:Skill and diligence in labour have a market value; wit 
lively imagination  and humour  have fancy value; on ,completion:
prompt:Neither nature nor art contains
anything which in default of these it could put in their place  for
their worth consists not in the effects which spring from them  not in
the use and advantage,completion: which they secure  but in the disposition of
mind  that is  the maxims of the will which are ready to manifest
themselves in such actions  even though they should not have the
desired effect.
prompt:These actions also need no recommendation from any
subjective taste or sentiment  that they may be looked on with
immediate favour and satisfaction: they need no immediate propension
or feeling for them; they exhibi,completion:t the will that performs them as an
object of an immediate respect  and nothing but reason is required
to impose them on the will; not to flatter it into them  which  in the
case of duties  would be a contradiction.
prompt:This estimation therefore
shows that the worth of such a disposition is dignity  and places it
infinitely above all valu,completion:
prompt:What then is it which justifies virtue or the mora,completion:lly good
disposition  in making such lofty claims?
prompt:It is nothing less than
the privilege it secures to the rational being of participating in the
giving of universal laws  by which it qualifies him to be a member
of a possible kingdom of ends  a privilege to which he was already
destined by his own nature as being an end,completion:
prompt:For nothing has any
worth ex,completion:
prompt:Now the legislation itself which
assigns the worth of everything must for that very reason possess
dignity  that is an unconditional ,completion:incomparable worth; and the word
respect alone supplies a becoming expression for the esteem which a
rational being must have for it.
prompt:Autonomy then is the basis of the
dignit,completion:y of human and of every rational nature.

been adduced are at bot,completion:

possible actions is analogous to the universal connexion of the
existence of things by general laws  which is the formal notio,completion:
prompt:Such then is the formula o,completion:f an
absolutely good will.
prompt:Rational nature is distinguished from the rest of ,completion:nature by this 
that it sets before itself an end.
prompt:This end would be the ma,completion:tter of
every good will.
prompt:But since in the idea of a will that is absolutely
good without being limited by any condition (of attaining this or that
end) we must abstract wholly from every end to be effected,completion:

negatively  i.e.

prompt:For that in using means for every end I should limit my
maxim by the condition of its holding good as a law for every subject

all maxims of action must be that the subject of all ends  i.e.
prompt:the

the supreme c,completion:
prompt:It follows incontestably that  to whatever laws any rational being
may be subject  he being an end in himself must be able to regard
himself as also legislating universally in respect of these same laws 
since it is just this fitness of his maxims for universal
legislation that distinguishes him as,completion: an end in himself; also it
follows that this implies his dignity (prerogative) above all mere
physical beings  that he must always take his maxims from the point of
view which regards himself and  likewise  every other rational being
as law-giving beings (on which account they are called persons).
prompt:In
this way a world of rational beings (mundus intelligibilis) is
possible as a king,completion:dom of ends  and this by virtue of the legislation
proper to all persons as members.
prompt:Therefore every rational being
must so act as if he were by his maxim,completion:
prompt:The formal principle of these
maxims is:  So act as if thy maxim we,completion:re to serve likewise as the
universal law (of all rational beings).
prompt:A kingdom of ends is thus
only possible on the analogy of a kingdom of nature  the former
however only by maxims  t,completion:hat is self-imposed rules  the latter only by
the laws of efficient causes acting under necessitation from
without.
prompt:Nevertheless  although the system of nature is looked upon as
a machine  yet so far as it has refe,completion:rence to rational beings as its
ends  it is given on this account the name of a kingdom of nature.
prompt:Now
such a kingdom of ends would be actually realized by means of maxims
conforming to the canon wh,completion:
prompt:But although a
rational being  even if he punctually follows this maxim himself 
cannot reckon upon all others being therefore true to the same  nor
expect that the kingdom of nature and its orderly arrangements shall
be in harmony with him as a fitting member  so as to form a kingdom of
end,completion:
prompt:And it is just in this that the paradox
lies; that the mere dignity of man as a rational creature  without any
other end or advantage to be attained thereby  in other words  respect
for a mere idea  should yet serve as an inflexible precept of the
will  and that it is precisely in this,completion: independence of the maxim on
all such springs of action that its sublimity consists; and it is this
that makes every rational subject worthy to be a legislative member in
the kingdom of ends: for otherwise he would have to be conceived
only as subject to the physical law of his wants.
prompt:And although we
should suppose the kingdom of nature and the kingdom of ends to be
united under one sovereign  so that the latter kingdom thereby
ceased to ,completion:be a mere idea and acquired true reality  then it would no
doubt gain the accession of a strong spring  but by no means any
increase of its intrinsic worth.
prompt:For this sole absolute lawgiver must 
notwithstanding this  be always conceived as estimating the worth of
rational ,completion:beings only by their disinterested behaviour  as prescribed
to themselves from that idea [the dignity of man] alone.
prompt:The essence
of things is not altered by their external relations  and that
which  abstracting from these  alone constitutes ,completion:the absolute worth of
man  is also that by which he must be judged  whoever the judge may
be  and even by the Supreme Being.
prompt:Morality  then  is the relation
of actions to the relation of actions will ,completion: that is  to the autonomy
of potential universal legislation by its maxims.

consistent with the autonomy of the will i,completion:s permitted; one that does
not agree therewith is forbidden.

autonomy (moral necessitation) is obligation.
prompt:This  then  cannot be

prompt:The objective necessity of action,completion:s from
obligation is called duty.

fulfils all his duties.

that they shall have no influence on the will  in order that practical
reason (will) ma,completion:y not be restricted to administering an interest not
belonging to it  but may simply show its own commanding authority as
the supreme legislation.

the happiness of others  not as if its realization involved any
concern of mine (whether by immediate inclination or by any
sati,completion:sfaction indirectly gained through reason)  but simply because a

one and the same volition.

for all rational beings without distinction  the unconditional
practical necessity which is thereby impos,completion:ed on them  is lost when
their foundation is taken from the particular constitution of human
nature  or the accidental circumstances in which it is placed.
prompt:The
principle of private happiness  however  is the most objectionable 
not merely because it is false  and experience contradicts the
supposition that prosperity is always proportioned to good conduct 
nor yet merely because it contributes nothing to the establishment
of morality- since it is quite a different thing to make a
prosperous man and a good man  or to make one,completion: prudent and
sharp-sighted for his own interests and to make him virtuous- but
because the springs it provides for morality are such as rather
undermine it and destroy its sublimity  since they put the motives
to virtue and to vice in the same class and only teach us to make a
better calculation  the specific difference between virtue and vice
being entirely extinguished.
prompt:On the other hand  as to moral feeling 
this supposed special sense  * the appeal to it is indeed superficial
when those who cannot think believe that feeling will help them out 
even in what concerns general laws: and besides  feelings  which
naturally differ infinitely in degree  cannot furnish a uniform
standard of good and evil  nor has anyone a rig,completion:ht to form judgements
for others by his own feelings: nevertheless this moral feeling is
nearer to morality and its dignity in this respect  that it pays
virtue the honour of ascribing to her immediately the satisfaction and
esteem we have for her and does not  as it were  tell her to her
face that we are not attached to her by her beauty but by profit.

attempting to distinguish specifically the reality of which we are now

cannot avoid tacitly presupposing the morality which it is to explain;
it is nevertheless preferable to the theological view  first 
because we have no intuition of the divi,completion:
prompt:However  if I had to choose between the notion of the moral sense
and that of perfection in general (two systems which at least do not
weaken morality  although they are totally incapable of serving as its
foundation)  then I should decide for the latter  because it at
least wit,completion:hdraws the decision of the question from the sensibility
and brings it to the court of pure reason; and although even here it
decides nothing  it at all events preserves the indefinite idea (of
a will good in itself free from corruption  until it shall be more
precisely defined.

refutation of all these doctrines; that would only be superfluous
labour  since it is so easy  and is pr,completion:

should act so and so: hence it can never command morally  that is 
categorically.
prompt:Whether the object determines the will by means of
inclination  as in the principle of private happiness  or by means
of reason directed to objects of our possible volition generally  as
in the principle of perfection  in either case the will never
determines itself immediately by the conception of the action  but
only by th,completion:e influence which the foreseen effect of the action has on
the will; I ought to do something  on this account  because I wish for
something else; and here there must be yet another law assumed in me
as its subject  by which I necessarily will this other thing  and this
law again requires an imperative to restrict this maxim.

influence which the conception of an object within the reach of our

      TRANSITION FROM THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS TO THE

           CRITIQUE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON



The Concept of Freedom is the Key that explains the Autonomy of
the Will



The will is a kind of causality belonging to living beings in so far
as they,completion: are rational  and freedom would be this property of such
causality that it can be efficient  independently of foreign causes
determining it; just as physical necessity is the property that the
causality of all irrational beings has of being determined to activity
by the influence of foreign causes.
prompt:The preceding definition of freedom is negative and therefore
unfruitful for the discovery of ,completion:
prompt:Since the conception of causality involves that of laws  according
to which  by something that we call cause  something else  namely
the effect  must be produced; hence  although freedom is not a
property of the w,completion:

the proposition:  The will is in every action a law to itself   only
expresses the principle,completion:
prompt:Now this is
precisely the formula of the categorical imperative and is the
principle o,completion:f morality  so that a free will and a will subject to moral
laws are one and the same.

                 of all Rational Beings



It is not enough to predicate ,completion:
prompt:For as morality serves as a law for us only
because we are rational beings  it must also hold for all rational
beings; and as i,completion:t must be deduced simply from the property of freedom 
it must be shown that freedom also is a property of all rational
beings.
prompt:It is not enough  then  to prove it from certain supposed
experiences of human nature (which indeed is quite impossible  and,completion:
prompt:Now I say
every being that cannot act except under the idea of freedom is just
for that reason in a practical point of view really free  that is to
say  all laws,completion: which are inseparably connected with freedom have the
same force for him as if his will had been shown to be free in
itself by a proof theoretically conclusive.

must attribute to every rational being which has a w,completion:ill that it has
also the idea of freedom and acts entirely under this idea.

such a being we conceive a reason that is practi,completion:

as the will of a rational being it must regard itself as free  t,completion:

point,completion: of view be ascribed to every rational being.

rational beings suppose in,completion:

is sufficient for my purpose; for even though the speculative proof

prompt:Of the Interest attaching to the Ideas of Morality



We have finall,completion:
prompt:This latter  however  we could not prove to be
actually a property of ourselves or of human nature; only we saw
that it m,completion:
prompt:as
endowed with a will; and so we find that on just the same grounds we
must ascribe to every being end,completion:owed with reason and will this
attribute of determining itself to action under the idea of its
freedom.
prompt:Now it resulted also from the presupposition of these ideas that
we ,completion:became aware of a law that the subjective principles of action 
i.e.
prompt:maxims  must always be so assumed that they can also hold as
objective  that ,completion:
prompt:But why then should I subject myself to
this principle and that simply as a r,completion:
prompt:I will allow
that no interest urges me to this  for that would not give a
categorical imperative  but I must take an interest in it and
discern how this comes to pa,completion:ss; for this properly an  I ought  is
properly an  I would   valid for every rational being  provided only
that reason determined his actions without any hindrance.

beings that are in addition affected as we are by springs of a
different kind  namely  sensibility  and in whose case that is not
always done,completion: which reason alone would do  for these that necessity is
expressed only as an  ought   and the subjective necessity is
different from the objective.
prompt:It seems then as if the moral law  that is  the principle of
autonomy of the will  were properly speaking only pr,completion:esupposed in the
idea of freedom  and as if we could not prove its reality and
objective necessity independently.
prompt:In that case we should still have
gained something considerable by at least determining the true
principle more exactly than had previo,completion:
prompt:For if we were asked why the
universal validity of our maxim as a law must be the condition
restricting our actions  and on what we ground the worth which we
assign to this manner of acting- a worth so great that there cannot be

prompt:We find indeed sometimes that we can take an interest in a
personal quality which does not involve any interest of external
condition  provided this quality makes us capable of participating
in,completion: the condition in case reason were to effect the allotment; that
is to say  the mere being worthy of happiness can interest of itself
even without the motive of participating in this happiness.
prompt:This
judgement  however  is in fact only the effect of the importance of
the moral law which we before presupposed (when by the id,completion:ea of freedom
we detach ourselves from every empirical interest); but that we
ought to detach ourselves from these interests  i.e.
prompt:to consider
ourselves as free in action and yet as subject to certain laws  so
as to find a worth simply in our own person which can compensate us
for the loss of everything that gi,completion:ves worth to our condition; this
we are not yet able to discern in this way  nor do we see how it is
possible so to act- in other words  whence the moral law derives its
obligation.
prompt:It must be freely admitted that there is a sort of c,completion:ircle here
from which it seems impossible to escape.
prompt:In the order of efficient
causes we assume ourselves free  in order that in the order of ends we
may conceive ourselves as subject to moral laws: and we afterwards
conceive ourselves as subject to these laws  because we have
attributed to ourselves freedom of will: for freedom and
self-legislation of will are both autonomy,completion:
prompt:One resource remains to us  namely  to inquire whether we do not
occupy different points of view when by means of freedom we think
ourse,completion:
prompt:It is a remark which needs no subtle reflection to make  but which
we may assume that even the commonest understanding can make  although
it be after its fashion by an obscure discernment of judgement which
it calls feeling  that all the  ideas  that come to us involuntarily
(as those of the senses) do not enable us to know objects o,completion:therwise
than as they affect us; so that what they may be in themselves remains
unknown to us  and consequently that as regards  ideas  of this kind
even with the closest attention and clearness that the understanding
can apply to them  we can by them only attain to the knowledge of
appearances  never to that of things in themselves.
prompt:As soon as this
distinction has once been made (perhaps merely in consequence of the
difference observed between the ideas given us from without  and in
which we are passive  and those that we produce simply from ourselves 
and in which we show our own activity)  then it follows of itself th,completion:
prompt:This must furnish a distinction  however crude 
between a world of sense and the world of understanding  of which
the former may be different according to the difference of the
sensuous impressions in,completion: various observers  while the second which is
its basis always remains the same  Even as to himself  a man cannot
pretend to know what he is in himself from the knowledge he has by
internal sensation.
prompt:For as he does not as it were create himself 
and does not come by the conception of himself a priori but
empirically  it naturally follows that he can obtain his ,completion:knowledge
even of himself only by the inner sense and  consequently  only
through the appearances of his nature and the way in which his
consciousness is affected.

characteristics of his own subject  made up of mere appearances  he

yet it cannot produce from its activity any other conceptions than
those which merely serve to bring the intuitions of sense under
rules and  thereby  to unite them in one consciousness  and without
this use of the sensibili,completion:
prompt:For this reason a rational being must regard himself qua
intelligence (not from the side of his lower faculties) as belonging
not to the world of sense  but to that of understanding; hence he
has two points of view from which he can regard himself  and recognise
laws of the exercise of his faculties ,completion: and consequently of all his
actions: first  so far as he belongs to the world of sense  he finds
himself subject to laws of nature (heteronomy); secondly  as belonging
to the intelligible world  under laws which being independent of
nature have their foundation not in experience but in reason alone.
prompt:As a rational being  and consequently belonging to the
intelligible world  man can never conceive the causality of his own
will otherwise than on condition of,completion:
prompt:Now the idea of freedom is inseparably connected with the conception
of autonomy  and this again with the universal principle,completion:

freedom because of the moral law only that we might afterwards in turn
infer the latter from freedom  and that consequently we could assign

ourselves into the world of understanding as members of it and

whereas  if we conceive ourselves as under obligation  we consider
ourselves as belonging to the world of sense and at the same time to
the world of understanding.

world of sense in which his actions  which are mere appearances

reason (namely  to extend its insight) is n,completion:ever direct  but
presupposes purposes for which reason is employed.
prompt:In order indeed that a rational being who is also affected through
the senses should will what reason alone directs such beings that they
ought to will  it is no doubt requisite that reason should have ,completion:a
power to infuse a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction in the
fulfilment of duty  that is to say  that it should have a causality by
which it determines the sensibility according to its own principles.
prompt:But it is quite impos,completion:
prompt:to make it intelligible a

can itself produce a sensation of pleasure or pain; for this ,completion:
prompt:But as this cannot supply us with any relation of
cause and effect except between two objects of experience  whereas
in this case  although indeed the effect produced lies within
experience  yet the cause is supposed to ,completion:be pure reason acting through
mere ideas which offer no object to experience  it follows that for us
men it is quite impossible to explain how and why the universality
of the maxim as a law  that is  morality  interests.
prompt:This only is
certain  that it is not because it interests us that it has validity
for us (for that would be heteronomy and dependence of practical
reason on sensibility  namely  on a feeling as its principle  in which
case it could never give moral laws)  but t,completion:
prompt:The question then   How a categorical imperative is possible   can
be answered to this extent  that we can assign the only hypothesis
on which it is possible  namely  the idea of freedom; and we can
also discern the necessity of this hypothes,completion:
prompt:On the hypothesis  however  that the
will of an intelligence is free  its autonomy ,completion:
prompt:Moreover  this freedom of will is not merely quite possible as a
hypothesis (not involving any contradiction to the principle of
physical necessity in the connexion of the phenomena of the sensible
world) as speculative philosophy can,completion: show: but further  a rational
being who is conscious of causality through reason  that is to say  of
a will (distinct from desires)  must of necessity make it practically 
that is  in idea  the condition of all his voluntary actions.
prompt:But to
explain how pure reason can be of itself practical without the aid,completion:
prompt:how the mere principle of the universal validity of all its
maxims as laws (which would certainly be the form of a pure
practical reason) can of itself supply a spring  without any matter

prompt:It is just the same as if I sought to find out how f,completion:
prompt:For then I quit the ground of

prompt:I might
indeed revel in the world of intelligences which still remains to
me  but although I have an idea of it which is well founded ,completion:
prompt:It
signifies only a something that remains over when I have eliminated
everything belonging to the world of sense from the actuating
principles of my will  serving merely to keep in bounds the
principle o,completion:f motives taken from the field of sensibility; fixing its
limits and showing that it does not contain all in all within
itself  but that there is more beyond it; but this something more I
know no further.

nothing but the form  namely  the practical law of the universality of
the maxims  and in conformity with this c,completion:onception of reason in
reference to a pure world of understanding as a possible efficient
cause  that is a cause determining the will.
prompt:There must here be a
total absence of springs; unless this idea of an intelligible world is
itself the spring  or that i,completion:n which reason primarily takes an
interest; but to make this intelligible is precisely the problem
that we cannot solve.
prompt:Here now is the extreme limit of all moral inquiry  and it is of
great importance to determine it even on this account  in order that
reason may not on the one hand  to the prejudice of morals  seek about
in the world of sense for the supreme motive and an ,completion:interest
comprehensible but empirical; and on the other hand  that it may not
impotently flap its wings without being able to move in the (for it)
empty space of transcendent concepts which we call the intelligible
world  and so lose itself amidst chimeras.
prompt:For the rest  the idea of a
pure world of understanding as a system of all intelligences  and to
which we ourselves as rational beings belong (although we are likewise
on the other side members of the sensible world)  this remains
always a useful and legitimate idea for the purposes of rational
belief  although all knowledge s,completion:
prompt:The speculative employment of reason with respect to nature leads to
the absolute necessity of some supreme cause of the world: the
practical ,completion:employment of reason with a view to freedom leads also to
absolute necessity  but only of the laws of the actions of a
rational being as such.
prompt:Now it is an essential principle of reason

however  an equally essential restriction of the same reason that it

further and further postponed.
prompt:Hence it unceasingly seeks the
unconditionally necessary and finds itself forced to assume it 
although without any means ,completion:
prompt:It is therefore no fault in our deduction of the
supreme principle of morality  but an objection that should be made to
human reason in genera,completion:l  that it cannot enable us to conceive the
absolute necessity of an unconditional practical law (such as the
categorical imperative must be).
prompt:It cannot be blamed for refusing to
explain this necessity by a condition  that is to say  by means,completion: of
some interest assumed as a basis  since the law would then cease to be
a supreme law of reason.

TRANSLATOR’S INTRODUCTION


This is an age of unions.

great practical organizations; but law  medicine  science  art

Peace Movements and Peace Societies  ,completion:of peace-loving monarchs and
peace-seeking diplomats.

solidarity of interest  but rivalries between nation and nation  the
bitternesses and hatreds inseparable from competition are not less
keen; prejudice and misun,completion:derstanding not less frequent; subordinate
conflicting interests are not fewer  are perhaps  in view of changing
political conditions and an ever-growing international commerce 
multiplying with every year.
prompt:The talisman is  perhaps  self-interest 
but  none the less  the spirit of union is there; it is impo,completion:ssible to
ignore a clearly marked tendency towards international federation 
towards political peace.

Societies; it,completion:s consummation lies perhaps far off in the ages to come.

called Fate when looked upon as the compelling force of a cause  the
laws of whose operation are unknown to us  is  when considered as the
purpose manifested in the course of nature  ,completion:called Providence [135]
as the deep-lying wisdom of a Higher Cause  directing itself towards
the ultimate practical end of the human race and predetermining the
course of things with a view to its realisation.

[_Kunstanstalten_] of nature; nor can we even conclude from the
fact of their existence that it is there; but  as in every relation
between the form of thin,completion:gs and their final cause  we can  and must

  idea of an end preconceived by the Author of the universe: this
  predetermination of nature on the part of God we generally call

  reason that ,completion:no single thing may be thought of as shut out from

ON THE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN MORALS AND POLITICS WITH REFERENCE TO
PERPETUAL PEACE


In an objective sense  mora,completion:ls is a practical science  as the sum of

falls to the ground of itself; “_ultra posse nemo obligatur_.” Hence
there can be no q,completion:uarrel between politics  as the practical science of
right  and morals  which is also a science of right  but theoretical.
prompt:That is  theory cannot come ,completion:into conflict with practice.
prompt:For  in that
case  we would need to understand under the term “ethics” or “morals”
a universal doctrine of expediency  or  in o,completion:ther words  a theory of
precepts which may guide us in choosing the best means for attaining
ends calculated for our advantage.

society can be c,completion:ounted upon than one that is brought about by force:

for himself such a system of ethics as may serve the interest of
statesmen.
prompt:The moral politician will always act upon the following
principle:—“If certain defects which could not have been avoided
are found in the political constitution or foreign relations of a
state  it is a duty for all  especially for the rulers of the state 
to apply their whole energy to correcting them as soon as possible 
and to bringing the constitution and political relations on these
points into conformity with the L,completion:aw of Nature  as it is held up as a
model before us in the idea of reason; and this they should do even
at a sacrifice of their own interest.” Now it is contrary to all
politics—which is  in this particular  in agreement with morals—to
dissever any of the links binding citizens together in the state
or nations in cosmopolitan union  before a better constitution is
there to take the place of what has been thus destroyed.

it would be absurd indeed to demand that every imperfe,completion:
prompt:But  at the

earnestly keep the maxim in mind which points to the necessity of
such ,completion:a change; so that he may go on constantly approaching the end

the laws of right.

although  while the revolution was going on  every one who took part
in it by use of force or stratagem  may have been justly punished
as a rebel.

the idea of right  on the pretext that human nature is not capable of

prompt:For  as it is not their business to reason too nicely over

proper authorities  the one which takes its place  will always seem
to them the best possible.

is purely mechanical.

to any circumstances may lead them to the delusion that they are
also capable of giving an opinion about ,completion:the principles of political
constitutions in general  in so far as they conform to ideas of

However  as in this philosophical and critical age such empiricism

prompt:INTRODUCTION

          ,completion:           INTRODUCTION.
prompt:Of the Idea of a Critiq,completion:ue of Practical Reason.
prompt:The theoretical use of reason was concerned with objects of the
cognitive faculty only  and a critical examination of it with
reference to this use applied properly only to the pure faculty of
,completion:cognition; because this raised the suspicion  which was afterwards
confirmed  that it might easily pass beyond its limits  and be lost
among unattainable objects  or even contradictory notions.
prompt:It is quite
different with ,completion:
prompt:In this  reason is
concerned with the grounds of determination of the will  which is a
faculty either to produce objects corresponding to ideas  ,completion:
prompt:For here  reason can at least attain so far as to determine
the will  and has al,completion:ways objective reality in so far as it is the
volition only that is in question.
prompt:The first question here then is
whether pure reason of itself alone suffices to determine the ,completion:
prompt:Now  here there comes in a notion of causality
justified by the critique of,completion: the pure reason  although not capable
of being presented empirically  viz.
prompt:that of freedom; and if we can
now discover means of proving that this property does in fact belong
to the human will (and so to the will of all rational beings)  then it
will not only be shown that pure reason can be p,completion:
prompt:For when once pure reason is shown to e,completion:xist  it needs no
critical examination.
prompt:For reason itself contains the standard for
,completion:the critical examination of every use of it.
prompt:The critique  then  of
practical reason generally is bound to prevent the empirically
condi,completion:tioned reason from claiming exclusively to furnish the ground
of determination of the will.
prompt:If it is proved that there is a
[practical] reason  its employment is alone immanent; the
empirically conditioned use  which c,completion:
prompt:This is just the opposite of what
might be sai,completion:
prompt:However  as it is still pure reason  the knowledge of which is
here the foundation of its practical employment  the general ,completion:outline
of the classification of a critique of practical reason must be
arranged in accordance with that of the speculative.
prompt:We must  then 
have the Elements and the Methodology of it; and in the former an
Analytic as the rule of tru,completion:th  and a Dialectic as the exposition and
dissolution of the illusion in the judgements of practical reason.
prompt:But
the order in the subdivision of the Analytic will be the r,completion:everse of
that in the critique of the pure speculative reason.
prompt:For  in the
present case  we shall commence with the principles and proceed to the
concepts  and only then  if possible  ,completion:to the senses; whereas in the
case of the speculative reason we began with the senses and had to end
with the principles.
prompt:The reason of this lies again in this: that now
we have to do with a will  and have t,completion:

conditioned  after which the attempt can be made to establish o,completion:

freedom  that is  with a pure pr,completion:actical principle  and this determines
the objects to which alone it can be applied.

Even supposing  however  that all finite rational beings were

must suppose that their mere form  by which they are fitted for

prompt:{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 145}



We have in the moral principle set forth a law of causality  the
determining principle of which is set above all the conditions of
the sensible world; we have it conceived how the will  as belonging
to the intelligible world  is determinable  and therefore have
its subject (man) not merely conceived as belonging to a world of
pure understandi,completion:ng  and in this respect unknown (which the critique of
speculative reason enabled us to do)  but also defined as regards
his causality by means of a law which cannot be reduced to any
physical law of the sensible world; and therefore our knowledge is
extended beyond the limits of that world  a pretension which the
Critique of Pure Reason declared to be futile in all speculation.
prompt:Now 
how is the practical use of pure reason here to be reconciled with,completion: the
theoretical  as to the determination of the limits of its faculty?
prompt:David Hume  of whom we may say that he commenced the assault on
the claims of pure reason  which made a thorough investigation of it
necessary  argued thus: The notion of cause is a notion that
involves the nec,completion:

connection  only in so far as it is known a priori  for experie,completion:
prompt:Now  it is impossible  says he  to
know a priori and as necessary the connection between one thing and
a,completion:
prompt:Therefore the notion of a
cause is fictitious and delusive and  to speak in the mildest way 
is an illusion  only excusable inasmuch as the custom (a subjective
necessity) of perceiving certain things  or their attributes as
often associated in existence along with or in succession to one
another  is insensibly taken for an objective nece,completion:ssity of supposing
such a connection in the objects themselves; and thus the notion of
a cause has been acquired surreptitiously and not legitimately; nay 
it can never be so acquired or authenticated  since it demands a
connection in itself vain  chimerical  and untenable in presence of
reason  and to which no object can ever correspond.
prompt:In this way was
empiricism first introduced as the sole source of principles  as far
as all knowledge of the existence of things is concerned
(mathema,completion:tics therefore remaining excepted); and with empiricism the
most thorough scepticism  even with regard to the whole science of
nature( as philosophy).
prompt:For on such principles we can never conclude
from given attributes of things as existing to a consequence (for this
would require the notion of cause  which involves th,completion:e necessity of
such a connection); we can only  guided by imagination  expect similar
cases- an expectation which is never certain  however often it has
been fulfilled.
prompt:Of no event could we say: a certain thing must have
preceded it  on which it necessarily followed; that is  it must have a
cause; and therefore  however frequent the cases we have known in
which there was such an antecedent  so that a rule could be derived
from them  yet we never could s,completion:uppose it as always and necessarily
so happening; we should  therefore  be obliged to leave its share to
blind chance  with which all use of reason comes to an end; and this
firmly establishes scepticism in reference to arguments ascending from
effects to causes and makes it impregnable.
prompt:Mathematics escaped well  so far  because Hume thought that its
propositions were analytical; that is  proceeded f,completion:rom one property
to another  by virtue of identity and  consequently  according to
the principle of contradiction.
prompt:This  however  is not the case  since 
on the contrary  they are synthetical; and although geometry  for
example  has not to do with the existence of things  but only with
their a priori p,completion:roperties in a possible intuition  yet it proceeds
just as in the case of the causal notion  from one property (A) to
another wholly distinct (B)  as necessarily connected with the former.
prompt:Nevertheless  mathematical science  so highly vaunted for its
apodeictic certainty  must at last fall under this empiricism for
the same reason for which Hume put custom in the place of objective
necessity in the notion of cause and  in spite of all its pride 
must consent to lower its bold pretension of claiming assent a
priori and depend for as,completion:
prompt:In this manner Hume's
empiricism leads inevitably to scepticism  even with regard to
mathematics  and conseq,completion:uently in every scientific theoretical use of
reason (for this belongs either to philosophy or mathematics).
prompt:Whether
with such a terrible overthrow of the chief branches of knowledge 
common reason will escape better  and will not rather become
irrecoverably involved in this destructio,completion:n of all knowledge  so that
from the same principles a universal scepticism should follow
(affecting  indeed  only the learned)  this I will leave everyone to
judge for himself.

It resulted  however  from my inquiries  that the objects with which
we have to do in experience are by no means things in themselves

themselves it is impossible to see how  if A is supposed  it should be
contradictory that B  which is quite different from A  should not also
be supposed (i.e.

cause and B as effect); yet it can very well be co,completion:nceived that  as

in which alone they are cognisable by us.
prompt:And so it was found to be in
fact; so that I was able not only to prove the objective reality of
the concept of cause in regard to objects of experience  but also to
deduce it as an a priori concept by reason of the necessity of the
connection it implied; that is  to show the possibility of its

by this  that  even while applied to objects of sense  its seat was
certainly fixed in the pure understanding; and although  when referred
to things in themselves (which canno,completion:t be objects of experience)  it is
not capable of being determined so as to represent a definite object
for the purpose of theoretic knowledge; yet for any other purpose (for
instance  a practical) it might be capable of being determined so as
to have such application.

speculation  even if we were successful in it  we should not really

the sensibly conditioned (in which we have already enough to do to
maintain ourselves  and to follow ca,completion:refully the chain of causes) to
the supersensible  in order to complete our knowledge of principles
and to fix its limits; whereas there always remains an infinite
chasm unfilled between those limits and what we know; and we should
have hearkened to a vain curiosity rather than a solid-desire of
knowledge.

objects (in theoretical knowledge)  it has also a relation to the

prompt:Now the notion of a being that has
free will is the notion of a causa noumenon  and that this notion
involves no contradiction  we are already assured by the fact- that
inasmuch as the concept of cause has arisen wholly from pure
understanding  and has its objective reality assu,completion:red by the deduction 
as it is moreover in its origin independent of any sensible
conditions  it is  therefore  not restricted to phenomena (unless we
wanted to make a definite theoretic use of it)  but can be applied
equally to things that are objects of the pure understanding.
prompt:But 
since this application cannot rest on any intuition (for intuition can
only be sensible)  therefore  caus,completion:a noumenon  as regards the theoretic
use of reason  although a possible and thinkable  is yet an empty
notion.
prompt:Now  I do not desire by means of this to understand
theoretically the nature of a being  in so far as it has a pure
will; it is enough for me to have thereby desig,completion:nated it as such  and
hence to combine the notion of causality with that of freedom (and
what is inseparable from it  the moral law  as its determining
principle).
prompt:Now  this right I certainly have by virtue of the pure 
not-empirical origin of the notion of cause  since I do not consider
mysel,completion:f entitled to make any use of it except in reference to the moral
law which determines its reality  that is  only a practical use.

prompt:Now  since the notions of good and evil  as consequences of the a
priori determination of the will  imply also a pure practical
principle  and therefore a causality of pure reason; hence they do not
originally refer to objects (so as to be  for instance  special
modes of the synthetic unity of the manifold of given intuitions in
one consciousness) like the pure concepts of th,completion:e understanding or
categories of reason in its theoretic employment; on the contrary 
they presuppose that objects are given; but they are all modes
(modi) of a single category  namely  that of causality  the

of a law  which as a law of freedom reason gives to itself  thereby
a priori proving itself practical.

prompt:{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 15}

These categories of freedom- for so we choose to call them in
contrast to those theoretic categories which are categories of
physical nature- have an obvious advantage over the latter  inasmuch
as the latter are only forms of thought which designate objects in
an indefinite manner by means of universal concept of every possible
intuition; the former  on the contrary  refer to the determination
of a free elective will (to which indeed no exactly corresponding
intuition,completion: can be assigned  but which has as its foundation a pure
practical a priori law  which is not the case with any concepts
belonging to the theoretic use of our cognitive faculties); hence 
instead of the form of intuition (space and time)  which does not
lie in reason itself  but has to be drawn from another source  namely 
the sensibility  these being elementary practical concepts have as
their foundation the form of a pure will  which is given in reason
and  therefore  in the thinking faculty itself.
prompt:From this it happens
that as all precepts of pure practical reason have to do only with the
determination of the will  not with the physical conditions (of
practical ability) of the execution of one's purpose  the practical
a priori principles in relation to the supreme principle of fr,completion:eedom
are at once cognitions  and have not to wait for intuitions in order
to acquire significance  and that for this remarkable reason 
because they themselves produce the reality of that to which they

theoretical concepts.

concept of the understanding  for which reason has a schema in the
sensible intuition.

it takes place  belongs to the ,completion:
prompt:Here  however  we
have to do  not with the schema of a case that occurs according to
laws  but with the schema of a law itself (if the word is allowable
here)  since the fact that the will (not the acti,completion:on relatively to
its effect) is determined by the law alone without any other
principle  connects the notion of causality with quite different
conditions from those which constitute physical connection.
prompt:The physical law being a law to which the objects of sensible
intuition  as such  are subject  must have a schema corresponding to
it- that is  a ,completion:general procedure of the imagination (by which it
exhibits a priori to the senses the pure concept of the
understanding which the law determines).
prompt:But the law of freedom
(that is  of a causality not subject to sensible conditions)  and
consequently the concept of the unconditi,completion:onally good  cannot have
any intuition  nor consequently any schema supplied to it for the
purpose of its application in concreto.

no faculty but the understanding to aid its application to physical
objects (not the imagination); and the understanding for the
purposes of the judgement can provide for an i,completion:

is this: ask yourself whether  if the action you propose were ,completion:to
take place by a law of the system of nature of which you were yourself
a part  you could regard it as possible by your own will.

when he thought it to his advantage; or thought himself justified in
shortening his life as soon as he was thorough,completion:

secretly allows himself to deceive  it does not follow that everyone
else does so; or if  unobserved  he is destitute of compassion  o,completion:thers

maxim of his actions with a universal law of nature is not the

result from a will determined by self-love  if this will at the same
time erected ,completion:itself into a universal law of nature  may certainly
serve as a perfectly suitable type of the morally good  but it is
not identical with it.
prompt:The same typic guards also against the
mysticism of practical reason  which turns what served only as a
symbol into a schema  that is  proposes to provide fo,completion:r the moral
concepts actual intuitions  which  however  are not sensible
(intuitions of an invisible Kingdom of God)  and thus plunges into the
transcendent.

only the rationalism of the judgement  which takes from the sensible
system of nature only what pure reason can also conceive of itself 
that i,completion:s  conformity to law  and transfers into the supersensible
nothing but what can conversely be actually exhibited by actions in

empirical interest  with which the inclinations generally are secretly

all the inclinations which (no matter what fashion they put on)
degrade humanity when they are raised to the dignity of a supreme

that would produce mere hypocrisy  without consistency; and it is ev,completion:

question how a law can be directly and of itself a determining
principle of the will (which is the essence o,completion:f morality)  this is  for
human reason  an insoluble problem and identical with the question:
how a free will is possible.
prompt:Therefore what we have to show a priori
is not why the moral law in itself supplies a motive  ,completion:but what
effect it  as such  produces (or  more correctly speaking  must
produce) on the mind.
prompt:{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 5}

The essential point in every determination of the will by the
moral law is that being a free will it is determined simply by the
moral law  not,completion: only without the co-operation of sensible impulses  but
even to the rejection of all such  and to the checking of all
inclinations so far as they might be opposed to that law.
prompt:So far 
then  the effect of the moral law as a motive is onl,completion:
prompt:For all inclination
and every sensible impulse is founded on feeling  and the negative
effect produced on feeling (by the check on the inclinations) is
itself feeling; consequently  we can see a priori that the moral
law  as a determining principle of the will  must by thwarting all our
,completion:inclinations produce a feeling which may be called pain; and in this
we have the first  perhaps the only  instance in which we are able
from a priori considerations to determine the relation of a
cognition (in this case of pure practical reason) to the feeling of
pleasure or displeasure.
prompt:All the inclinations together (which can be
reduced to a tolerable system  in which,completion: case their satisfaction is
called happiness) constitute self-regard (solipsismus).
prompt:This is either
the self-love that consists in an excessive fondness,completion:
prompt:The former
is called particularly s,completion:
prompt:Pure
practical reason only checks selfishness  looking on it as natural and
active in us even prior to the moral ,completion:law  so far as to limit it to the
condition of agreement with this law  and then it is called rational
self-love.
prompt:But self-conceit reason strikes down altogether  since
all claims to self-esteem which precede agreement with the moral law
are vain and unjustifiable  for the certainty of a state of mind,completion:
prompt:Now the
propensity to self-esteem is one of the inclinations which t,completion:he moral
law checks  inasmuch as that esteem rests only on morality.
prompt:Therefore the moral law ,completion:

something positive in itself  namely  the form of an intellectual
causality  that is  of freedom  it must be an object of respect;
for  by opposing the subjective antagonism of the inclinations  it
weakens self,completion:
prompt:Therefore respect
for the moral law is a feeling which is produced by an intellectual
cause  and t,completion:
prompt:In the preceding chapter we have seen that everything that
presents itself as an object of the will prior to the moral law is
by that law itself  which is the supreme condition of practical
reason  excluded from the determining principles of the will which
we have called,completion:
prompt:However  we find that our nature as sensible
beings is such that the matter of desire (objects of inclination 
whether of hope or fear) first presents itself to us; and our
pathologically affected self  althoug,completion:
prompt:This propensity to make
ourselves in the subjective determining principles of our choice serve
as the objective determining principle of the will,completion: generally may be
called self-love; and if this pretends to be legislative as an
unconditional practical principle it may be called self-conceit.
prompt:Now
the moral law  which alone is truly objective (namely  in every
respect)  entirely excludes the influence of self-love on the
su,completion:preme practical principle  and indefinitely checks the
self-conceit that prescribes the subjective conditions of the former
as laws.
prompt:Now whatever checks our self-conceit in our own judgement
humiliates; therefore the moral law ,completion:inevitably humbles every man
when he compares with it the physical propensities of his nature.
prompt:That  the idea of which as a determining principle of our will humbles
us in our self-consciou,completion:sness  awakes respect for itself  so far as
it is itself positive and a determining principle.
prompt:Therefore the moral
law is even ,completion:subjectively a cause of respect.
prompt:Now since everything that
enters into self-love belongs to inclination  and all inclination
rests on feelings  and consequently whatever checks all the feelings
together in self-love has necessarily  by this very circumstance  an

prompt:No
special kind of feeling need be assumed for this under the name of a
practica,completion:l or moral feeling as antecedent to the moral law and
serving as its foundation.
prompt:The negative effect on feeling (unpleasantness) is pathological 
,completion:like every influence on feeling and like every feeling generally.
prompt:But as an effect of the consciousness of the moral law  and
consequently in relation to a supersensible cause  namely  the subject

self-conceit of its illusion  it lessens the obstacle to pure

prompt:Thus the respect for the law is not a
motive to morality  but is morality itself subjectively considered
as a motive  inasmuch as pu,completion:re practical reason  by rejecting all the
rival pretensions of self-love  gives authority to the law  which now
alone has influence.
prompt:Now it is to be observed that as respect is an
effect on feeling  and therefore on the sensibility  of a rational
being  it presupposes this sensibility  and therefore also the
finiteness of such beings on whom the mo,completion:ral law imposes respect; and
that respect for the law cannot be attributed to a supreme being  or
to any being free from all sensibility  in whom  therefore  this
sensibility cannot be an obstacle to practical reason.
prompt:This feeling (which we call the moral feeli,completion:ng) is therefore produced
simply by reason.

nor for the foundation of the ob,completion:jective moral law itself  but merely
as a motive to make this of itself a maxim.

interest well understood  but that we want to be free from the

severity?

in it that if once one has laid aside self-conceit and allowed
practical influence to that respect  he can never b,completion:e satisfied with

and therefore as meritorious  and this notably reduces ou,completion:r
self-conceit  and either casts a reproach on us or urges us to
follow such an example in the way that is suitable to us.
prompt:This

the law that his example exhibits) is not mere admiration; and this is

agreement with the moral law  is reduced to nothing); hence  the
effect of this law on feeling is merely humiliation.

of the pu,completion:re practical law as a motive  but only the resistance to

since practical reason has not to do with objects so as to know

is produced by this as a constraint  namely  by the feeling of a

necessity  of the moral law as the supreme practical law of rational
beings  to whom we attribute freedom of causality of their will;
because both concepts are so inseparably united that we might define
practical freedom as independence of the will on anything but the

If  then  we would attribute freedom to a being whose existence is

and to attribute freedom to the same being as a thing in itself.
prompt:This is certainly inevitable  if we would retain both these
contradictory concepts together; but in application  when we try to
explain t,completion:heir combination in one and the same action  great
difficulties present themselves which seem to render such a
combination impracticable.
prompt:When I say of a man who commits a theft that  by the law of
causality  this deed is a necessary result of the determining causes
in preceding time  then it was impossible that it could not have
happened; how then can the judgement  according to the moral law  make
any ,completion:change  and suppose that it could have been omitted  because the
law says that it ought to have been omitted; that is  how can a man be
called quite free at the same moment  and with respect to the same
action in which he is subject to an inevitable physical necessity?

solution of which centuries have laboured in vain  and which can
therefore scarcely be found so completely on the surface.
prompt:In fact 
in the question about the freedom which must be the foundation of
all moral laws and the consequent responsibility  it does not matter
whether the principles which necessarily determine causality by a
physical law reside within the subject or without him  o,completion:
prompt:Then it
matters not that these are internal; it matters not that they have a
psychological and not a mechanical causality  that is  produce actions
by means of ideas and not by bodily movements; they are still
determinin,completion:
prompt:This may imply psychological freedom (if
we choose to apply this term to a merely internal chain of ideas in
the mind)  but it involves physical necessity and  therefore  leaves
no room for transcendental freedom ,completion:
prompt:Without this
freedom (in the latter and true sense)  which alone is p,completion:ractical a
priori  no moral law and no moral imputation are possible.
prompt:Just for
this reason the necessity of events in time  according to the physical
law of causality  may be called the mec,completion:hanism of nature  although we
do not mean by this that things which are subject to it must be really
material machines.
prompt:We look here only to the necessity of the
connection of events in a time-series as it is developed according
to the physical law  whether the subject in which this development
takes place is called automaton materiale when the mechanical being is
moved by matter  or with Leibnitz spirituale when it is im,completion:pelled by
ideas; and if the freedom of our will were no other than the latter
(say the psychological and comparative  not also transcendental 
that is  absolute)  then it would at bottom be nothing better than the
freedom of a turnspit  which  when once it is wound up  accomplishes
its motions of itself.
prompt:Now  in order to remove in the supposed case the apparent
contradiction between freedom and the mechanism of nature in ,completion:one and
the same action  we must remember what was said in the Critique of
Pure Reason  or what follows therefrom; viz.
prompt:that the necessity of
nature  which cannot co-exist with the freedom of the subject 
appertains only to the attributes of the thing that is subject to
time-conditions  consequently only to those of the acting subject as a
phenomenon; that therefore in this re,completion:spect the determining
principles of every action of the same reside in what belongs to
past time and is no longer in his power (in which must be included his
own past actions and the character that these may determine for him in
his own eyes as a phenomenon).
prompt:But the very same subject  being on the
other side conscious of himself as a thing in himself  considers his
existence also in so far as it is not subject to time-conditions 
and regards himself as only determinable by laws which he gives
himself through reason; and in this his existence nothing is
antecedent to the determination of his w,completion:ill  but every action  and
in general every modification of his existence  varying according to
his internal sense  even the whole series of his existence as a
sensible being is in the consciousness of his supersensible
existence nothing but the result  and never to be regarded as the
determining principle  of his causality as a noumenon.
prompt:In this view
now the rational being can justly say of every unlawful action that he
performs  that he could very well have left it undone; although as
appearance it is sufficiently determined in the past  and in this
respect is absolutely necessary;,completion: for it  with all the past which
determines it  belongs to the one single phenomenon of his character
which he makes for himself  in consequence of which he imputes the
causality of those appearances to himself as a cause independent on
sensibility.

faculty in us which we call conscience.
prompt:A man may use as much art as
he likes in order to paint to himself an unlawful act  that he
remembers  as an unintentional error  a mere oversight  such as one
can never altogether avoid  and therefore as something in which he was
carried away by the stream of physical necessity  and thus to make
himself out innocent  yet he finds that the advocate who speaks in his

there is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still
favourable to freedom; namely  that the same difficulty presses much
more strongly (in fact as we shall presently see  presses only) on the
system that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be

to give up our capital supposition of the ideality of time as a mere
form of sensible intuition  and consequently as a mere manner of
representation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the
world of sense; and therefore it only requires that this view be
reconciled with this idea.
prompt:The difficulty is as follows: Even if it is admitted that the
supersensible subject can be free with respect to a given action 
although  as a subject also belonging to the world of sense  he is
under mechanical conditions with respect to the same action  still  as
soon as we allow that God as universal first cause is also the cause
of the existence of substance (a proposition which can never be
given up without at the same time giv,completion:ing up the notion of God as the
Being of all beings  and therewith giving up his all sufficiency  on
which everything in theology depends)  it seems as if we must admit
that a man's actions have their determining principle in something
which is wholly out of his power- namely  in the causality of a
Supreme Being distinct from himself and on whom his own existence
and the whole determination of his causality are absolutely dependent.

the creation of these beings is a creation of things in themselves

prompt:The categories of the second class (those of causality and of the
necessity of a thing) did not require this homogeneity (of the
conditioned and the condition in synthesis)  since here what we have to
explain is not how the intuition is compounded from a manifold in it 
but only how the existence of the conditioned object corresponding to it
is added to the existence of the condition (adde,completion:d  namely  in the
understanding as connected therewith); and in that case it was allowable
to suppose in the supersensible world the unconditioned antecedent to
the altogether conditioned in the world of sense (both as regards the
causal connection and the contingent existence of things themselves) 
although this unconditioned remained indeterminate  and to make the
synthesis transcendent.

prompt:Hence  nothing remained but to find
an incontestable objective principle of causality which excludes all
sensible conditions: that is  a principle in which reason does not
appeal further to ,completion:something else as a determining ground of its
causality  but contains this determining ground itself by means of that
principle  and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical.
prompt:Now  this principle had not to be searched for or discovered; it had
long been in the ,completion:reason of all men  and incorporated in their nature 
and is the principle of morality.
prompt:Therefore  that unconditioned
causality  with the faculty of it  namely  freedom  is no longer merely
indefinitely and problematically thought (this speculative reason could
prove to be feasible)  but is even as regards the law of its causality
definitely and assertorially known; and with it the fact that a being (I

can help,completion: us to effect the connection of such a supersensible being with
the world of sense (since the necessary being would have to be known as
given outside ourselves).
prompt:On the other hand  it is now obvious that this
connection is quite possible in relation to our own subject  inasmuch as
I know myself to be on the one ,completion:side as an intelligible [supersensible]
being determined by the moral law (by means of freedom)  and on the
other side as acting in the world of sense.
prompt:It is the concept of freedom
alone that enables us to find the unconditioned an,completion:d intelligible for the
conditioned and sensible without going out of ourselves.
prompt:For it is our
own reason that by means of the supreme and unconditional practical law
knows that itself and the being that is conscious of,completion: this law (our own
person) belong to the pure world of understanding  and moreover defines
the manner in which  as such  it can be active.
prompt:In this way it can be
understood why in the whole faculty of reason it is the practical reason
only that can help us to pass beyond the world of sense and give us,completion:
knowledge of a supersensible order and connection  which  however  for
this very reason cannot be extended further than is necessary for pure
practical purposes.

practical sphere where no attention is paid to subtle speculation

been thought out with deliberate purpose to establish this
confirmation.

absolute totality of the 'conditions of what is given conditioned  and
this can only be found in things in themselves.
prompt:But as all conceptions
of things in themselves must be referred to intuitions  and with us
men these can never be other than sensible and hence can never
enable us to know objects as things in themselves but only as
appearances  and since the unconditioned can never be found in this
chain of appearances which consists ,completion:only of conditioned and
conditions; thus from applying this rational idea of the totality of
the conditions (in other words of the unconditioned) to appearances 
there arises an inevitable illusion  as if these latter were things in
themselves (for in the absence of a warning critique they are always
regarded as such).
prompt:This illusion would never be noticed as delusive if
it did not betray itself by a conflict of reason with itself  w,completion:

reason is compelled to trace this illusion to its source  and search
how it can be removed  and this can only be done by a complete

law) it seeks the unconditioned totality of the object of pure
practical reason under the name of the summum bonum.
prompt:To define this ide,completion:

of our rational conduct  is the business of practical wisdom  and this
again as a science is philosophy  in the sense in which the word was
,completion:understood by the ancients  with whom it meant instruction in the
conception in which the summum bonum was to be placed  and the conduct
by which it was to be obtained.
prompt:It would be well to leave this word in
its ancient signification as a doctrine,completion: of the summum bonum  so far as
reason endeavours to make this into a science.
prompt:For on the one hand the
restriction annexed would suit the Greek expression (which signifies
the love of wisdom)  and yet at the same time would be sufficient to
embrace under the name of philosophy the love of science: that is to
say  of all speculative rati,completion:onal knowledge  so far as it is
serviceable to reason  both for that conception and also for the
practical principle determining our conduct  without letting out of
sight the main end  on account of which alone it can be called a
doctrine of practical wisdom.
prompt:On the other hand  it would be no harm
to deter the self-conceit of one who ventures to claim the title of
philosopher ,completion:by holding before him in the very definition a standard of
self-estimation which would very much lower his pretensions.

philosopher who could not also show its infallible effects in his

the ancients also required as a condition of deserving that honourable

We have another preliminary remark to make respecting the
dialectic of the pure practical reason  on the point of the definition
of the summum bonum (a successful solution of which dialectic would
lead us to,completion: expect  as in case of that of the theoretical reason  the

so delicate a case as the determination of mor,completion:al principles  where the

to morality (which is the worth of the person  and his worthiness to
be happy) constitutes the summum bonum of a possible world; hence this

virtue as the condition is always the supreme good  since it has no

this latter had set to itself  and gives it up to every nonsense or
delusion of imagination?
prompt:In fact  so far as practical reason is taken as dependent on
pathological conditions  that is  as merely regulating the
inclinati,completion:ons under the sensible principle of happiness  we could not
require speculative reason to take its principles from such a
source.
prompt:Mohammed's paradise  or the absorption into the Deity of the
theosophists and mystics would press their monstrosities on the rea,completion:son
according to the taste of each  and one might as well have no reason
as surrender it in such fashion to all sorts of dreams.
prompt:But if pure
reason of itself can be practical and is actually so  as the
consciousness of the moral law proves  then it is still only one and
the same reason which  whether in a theoretical or a practical point
of view  judges according to a priori principles; and then it is clear
that although it is in the first point of view incompetent to
establish certain propositions positively  which  however  ,completion:do not
contradict it  then  as soon as these propositions are inseparably
attached to the practical interest of pure reason  it must accept
them  though it be as something offered to it from a foreign source 
something that has not grown on its own ground  but yet is
sufficiently authenticated; and it must try to compare and connect
them with everything that it has in its power as speculative reason.

insight  but yet are extensions of its employment in another

necessary condition of the possibility of the summum bonum (an
object of the will which is necessarily connected with the moral
legislation of pure reason).
prompt:We proceed to exhibit this con,completion:

whom everything goes according to his wish and will; it rests 
t,completion:herefore  on the harmony of physical nature with his whole end and

prompt:Nevertheless  in the practica,completion:

necessary pursuit of the summum bonum  such a connection is postulated
as necessary,completion:
prompt:Accordingly  the existence of a
cause of all nature  distinct from nature itself and containing the
pri,completion:nciple of this connection  namely  of the exact harmony of
happiness with morality  is also postulated.
prompt:Now this supreme cause
must contain the principle of the harmony of nature  not merely with a
law of the will of rational beings  but with the conception of this
law  in so far as they ,completion:make it the supreme determining principle of
the will  and consequently not merely with the form of morals  but
with their morality as their motive  that is  with their moral
character.
prompt:Therefore  the summum bonum is possible in the world only
on the suppositi,completion:on of a Supreme Being having a causality corresponding
to moral character.
prompt:Now a being that is capable of acting on the
conception of laws is an intelligence (a rational being)  and the
causality of such a being according to this conception of laws is
his will; therefor,completion:e the supreme cause of nature  which must be
presupposed as a condition of the summum bonum is a being which is the
cause of nature by intelligence and will  consequently its author 
that is God.
prompt:It follows that the postulate of the possibility of the
highest derived good (the best world) is like,completion:
prompt:Now it was seen to be a duty for us to promote the summum
bonum; consequently it is not merely allowable  but it is a
necessity connected with duty as a requisite  that we should
presuppose the possibility of ,completion:this summum bonum; and as this is
possible only on condition of the existence of God  it inseparably
connects the supposition of this with duty; that is  it is morally
necessary to assume the existence of God.
prompt:It must be remarked here that this moral necessity is subjective 
that is  it is a want  and not objective  that is  itself a duty,completion: 
for there cannot be a duty to suppose the existence of anything (since
this concerns only the theoretical employment of reason).

is not meant by this that it is necessary to suppose the existence
of God as a basis of all obli,completion:gation in general (for this rests  as has

prompt:The Epicureans had indeed assumed as the supreme
principle of morality a wholly false one  namely that of happiness 
and had substituted for a law a maxim of arbitrary choice according to
every man's inclination; they proceeded  however  consistently
enough in this  that they degraded their summum bonum likewise  just
in proportion to the meanness of their fundam,completion:ental principle  and
looked for no greater happiness than can be attained by human prudence
(including temperance and moderation of the inclinations)  and this as
we know would be scanty enough and would be very different according
to circumstances; not to mention the exceptions that their maxims must
perpetually admit and which make them incapable of being laws.
prompt:The
Stoics  on the contrary  had chosen their supreme practical
principle quite rightly  making virtue the condition of the summum
bonum; but when they represented the degree of virtue required by
its pure law as fully attainable in this life  they not only
strained the moral powers of the man whom they called the wise

is not possible without presupposing three theoretical conceptions

which the latter could not assure them.

related to an object  and th,completion:is  too  is still not a cognition of these
objects; for we cannot thereby form any synthetical judgement about
them  nor determine their application theoretically; consequently 
we can make no theoretical rational use of them at all  in which use
all speculative knowledge of reason consists.
prompt:Nevertheless  the
theoretical knowledge  not indeed of these objects  but of reason
generally  is so far enlarged by this  that by the pra,completion:ctical

is therefore no extension of the knowledge of given supersensible
objects  but an extension of theoretical reason and of its knowledge
in respect of the supersensible generally; inasmuch as it is compelled

required to admit it; but that ,completion:speculative reason must concede it

basis (in practical reason); the possibility of the ,completion:same in general is

objectively in what way we are to conceive this possibility; whether
by univers,completion:al laws of nature without a wise Author presiding over

in a subjective condition of reason  the only way theoretically

then the motive is already so,completion:

postpone everything to the holiness of duty alone  and to be conscious
that we can because our own reason recognises this as its command
and says that we ought to do it  this is  as it were  to raise
ourselves altogether above the world of sense  and there is
inseparably involved in the same a consciousness of the law  as ,completion:
prompt:{PART_2|METHODOLOGY ^paragraph 25}

The,completion:
prompt:At first we are only
concerned to make the judging of actions by moral laws a natural
employment accompanying all our own free actions  as well as the
observation of those of others  and to make it as it were a habit  and
to sharpen this judgement  asking first whether the action conforms
objectively to the moral law  and to what law; and we distinguish
the law that merely furnishes a p,completion:rinciple of obligation from that
which is really obligatory (leges obligandi a legibus obligantibus);
as  for instance  the law of what men's wants require from me  as
contrasted with that which their rights demand  the latter of which
prescribes essential  the former only non-essential duties; and thus
we teach how to distinguish different kinds of duties which meet in
the same action.
prompt:The other point to which attention must be directed
is the question whether the action was also (subjectively) done for
the sake of the mo,completion:ral law  so that it not only is morally correct as a
deed  but also  by the maxim from which it is done  has moral worth as
a disposition.
prompt:Now there is no doubt that this practice  and the
resulting culture of our reason in judging merely of the practic,completion:al 
must gradually produce a certain interest even in the law of reason 
and consequently in morally good actions.
prompt:For we ultimately take a
liking for a thing  the contemplation of which makes us feel that
the use of our cognitive faculties is extended; and this extension
is especially furthered by that i,completion:n which we find moral correctness 
since it is only in such an order of things that reason  with its
faculty of determining a priori on principle what ought to be done 
can find satisfaction.
prompt:An observer of nature takes liking at last to
objects that at first offended his senses  when he discovers in ,completion:them
the great adaptation of their organization to design  so that his
reason finds food in its contemplation.
prompt:So Leibnitz spared an insect
that he had carefully examined with the microscope  and replaced it on
its leaf,completion:  because he had found himself instructed by the view of it
and had  as it were  received a benefit from it.
prompt:But this employment of the faculty of judgement  which makes us feel
our own co,completion:
prompt:It merely causes us to take pleasure in
engaging in such criticism  and it gives to virtue or the
disposition that conforms to moral laws a form of beauty  which is
admired  but not on that account sought after (laudatur et alget);
as everything the contemplation of which produces a consciousness of
the harmony of our powers of conception  and in which we,completion: feel the
whole of our faculty of knowledge (understanding and imagination)
strengthened  produces a satisfaction  which may also be
communicated to others  while nevertheless the existence of the object
remains indifferent to us  being only regarded as the occasion of
our becoming aware of the capacities in us which are elevated above
mere animal nature.
prompt:Now  however  the second exercise comes in  the
living exhibition of morality of character by examples  in which
attention is directed to purity of,completion:
prompt:By this the
pupil's attention is fixed upon the consciousness of his freedom 
and although this renunciation at first excites a feeling of pain 
nevertheless  by its withdrawing the pupil from the constraint of even
real want,completion:s  there is proclaimed to him at the same time a
deliverance from the manifold dissatisfaction in which all these wants
entangle him  and the mind is made capable of receiving the
sensation of satisfaction from other sources.
prompt:The heart is freed and
lightened of a burden that always secretly presses on it  when
instances of pure moral resolutions reveal to the man an inner faculty
of which otherwise he has no right knowledge  the inward fr,completion:eedom to
release himself from the boisterous importunity of inclinations  to
such a degree that none of them  not even the dearest  shall have
any influence on a resolution  for which we are now to employ our
reason.
prompt:Suppose a case where I alone know that the wrong is on my
side  and although a free confession of it and the offer of
satisfaction are so strongly opposed by vanity  selfishness  and
even an otherwise not illegitimate antipathy to the man whose rights
are impaired by m,completion:e  I am nevertheless able to discard all these
considerations; in this there is implied a consciousness of
independence on inclinations and circumstances  and of the possibility
of being sufficient for myself  which is salutary to me in general for
other purposes also.
prompt:And now the law of duty  in consequence of the
positive worth which obedience to it makes us f,completion:
prompt:When this is well established  when a man dreads nothing more
than to find himself  on self-examination  worthless and
contemptible in his own eyes  then every good ,completion:moral disposition can be
grafted on it  because this is the best  nay  the only guard that
can keep off from the mind the pressure of ignoble and corrupting
motives.

      ,completion:
prompt:Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and
awe  the oftener and,completion: the more steadily we reflect on them: the
starry heavens above and the moral law within.
prompt:I have not to search
for them and conjecture them as though they were veiled in darkness or
were in the transcende,completion:
prompt:The former begins from the place I occupy in the external world of
sense  and enlarges my connection therein to an unbounded extent
wit,completion:h worlds upon worlds and systems of systems  and moreover into
limitless times of their periodic motion  its beginning and
continuance.
prompt:The second begins from my invisible self  my personality 
and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity  but which is
traceable only by the understanding ,completion: and with which I discern that I
am not in a merely contingent but in a universal and necessary
connection  as I am also thereby with all those visible worlds.
prompt:The
former view of a countless multitude of worlds annihilates as it
were my importance as an animal creature  which after it has been
for a short time pro,completion:vided with vital power  one knows not how  must
again give back the matter of which it was formed to the planet it
inhabits (a mere speck in the universe).
prompt:The second  on the
contrary  infinitely elevates my worth as an intelligence by my
personality  in which the moral law reveals to me a life independent
of animality and even of the whole sensible wo,completion:rld  at least so far
as may be inferred from the destination assigned to my existence by
this law  a destination not restricted to conditions and limits of
this life  but reaching into the infinite.

depends on the use of reason  a use which does not come of itself

attributes are in question which cannot be directly exhibited in

prompt:But after the maxim had come into vogue  though
late  to examine carefully beforehand all the steps that reason
purposes to take  and not to let it proceed otherwise than in the

structure of the universe took quite a different direction  and
thereby attained an incomparably happier result.

conditions.

prompt:PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 1787


Whether the treatment of that portion of our knowledge which lies
within the province of pure ,completion:reason advances with that undeviating
certainty which characterizes the progress of _science_  we shall be at
no loss to determine.
prompt:If we find those who are engaged in metaphysical
pursuits  unable to come to an understanding as to the method which
they ought to follow; if we find them  after the most elaborate
preparations  invariably brought to a stand before the goal is ,completion:reached 
and compelled to retrace their steps and strike into fresh paths  we
may then feel quite sure that they are far from having attained to the
certainty of scientific progress and may rather be said to be merely
groping about in the dark.
prompt:In these circumstances we shall render an
important service to reason if we succeed in simply indicating the path
along which it must travel  in order to ,completion:arrive at any results—even if
it should be found necessary to abandon many of those aims which 
without reflection  have been proposed for its attainment.

and allow them to run into one another.

limits which admit of perfectly clear definition; it is a science which
has for its object nothing but the exposition and proof of the _formal_
laws of,completion:
prompt:The early success of logic must be attributed exclusively to the
narrowness of its field  in which abstraction may  or rather must  be
made of all ,completion:
prompt:It is  obviously  a much more difficult
task for reason to strike into the sure path of s,completion:cience  where it has
to deal not simply with itself  but with objects external to itself.
prompt:Hence  logic is properly only a _propædeutic_—forms  as it were  the
vestibule of the sciences; and while it is necessary to enable us to
form a correct judgement with regard to t,completion:he various branches of
knowledge  still the acquisition of real  substantive knowledge is to
be sought only in the sciences properly so called  that is  in the
objective sciences.

figure  as it lay before his eyes  or the conception of it  as it

properties  but that it was necessary to produce these properties  as
it were  by a pos,completion:itive _à priori construction;_ and that  in order to
arrive with certainty at _à priori_ cognition  he must not attribute to

an excellent test of the new method of thought which we have ado,completion:pted 
and which is based on the principle that we only cognize in things _à

prompt:[4]

 [4] This method  accordingly  which we have borrowed from the natural
 philosopher  consists in see,completion:king for the elements of pure reason in
 that _which admits of confirmation or refutation by experiment_.
prompt:Now
 the propositions of pure reason  especially when they transcend the
 limits of possible exp,completion:erience  do not admit of our making any
 experiment with their _objects_  as in natural science.

 regard to those _conceptions_ and _principles_ which we assume ,completion:_à

 sides.

metaphysics  in its first part—that is  where it is occupi,completion:ed with
conceptions _à priori_  of which the corresponding objects may be given

prompt:For by this new method we
are enabled perfectly to explain the possibility of _à priori_
cognition  and  what is more  to demonstrate satisfactorily the laws
whi,completion:
prompt:But from this deduction of the faculty of
_à priori_ cognition in the first part of metaphysics  we derive a
surprising ,completion:result  and one which  to all appearance  militates against
the great end of metaphysics  as treated in the second part.
prompt:For we
come to the conclusion that our faculty of cognition is unable to
transcend the limits,completion: of possible experience; and yet this is precisely
the most essential object of this science.
prompt:The estimate of our rational
cognition _à priori_ at which we arrive is that it has only to do with,completion:

jus,completion:tice of this estimate to the test.
prompt:For that which of necessity
impels us to transcend the limits of experience and of all phenomena is
the _unconditioned,completion:
prompt:Now 
if it appears that when  on the one hand  we assume that our cognition
conforms to its objects as things in themselves  _the unconditioned
cannot be thought without contradiction_  and that when  on the other
hand  we assume that our representation of things as they are given to
us  does not conform to these things as they are in themselves  but
that these objects  as pheno,completion:mena  conform to our mode of
representation  _the contradiction disappears:_ we shall then be
convinced of the truth of that which we began by assuming for the sake
of experiment; we may look upon it as established that the
unconditioned does not lie in things as we know them  or as they are
given to us  but in things as they are in themselves  beyond the range
of our cognition.
prompt:[5]

 [5] This experiment of pure reason has a great similarity to that of

 more usually  the _synthetic_ process.

 harmony with the necessary rational idea of the unconditioned  and
 finds ,completion:that this harmony never results except through the above
 distinction  which is  therefore  concluded to be just.
prompt:But  after we have thus denied the power of speculative reason to make
any progress in the sphere of the supersensible  it still remains for
our consideration whether data do not exist in _practical_ cognition
which,completion: may enable us to determine the transcendent conception of the
unconditioned  to rise beyond the limits of all possible experience
from a _practical_ point of view  and thus to satisfy the great ends of
metaphysics.
prompt:Speculative reason has thus  at least  made room for such
an extension of our knowledge: and  if it must leave this space vacant 
still,completion: it does not rob us of the liberty to fill it up  if we can  by
means of practical data—nay  it even challenges us to make the
attempt.

prompt:But  at the same time  it marks out and defines
both the ext,completion:ernal boundaries and the internal structure of this
science.
prompt:For pure speculative reason has this peculiarity  that  in
choosing the various objects of thought  it is able to define the
limits of its own faculties,completion:
prompt:For  on the one hand  in
cognition _à priori_  nothing must be attributed to the objects but
what the thinking subject derives from itself; and  on the other hand 
reason is  in regard to the principles of cognition  a perfectly
distinct  independent unity  in w,completion:hich  as in an organized body  every
member exists for the sake of the others  and all for the sake of each 
so that no principle can be viewed  with safety  in one relationship 
unless it is  at the same time  viewed in relation to the total use of
pure reason.

advantage which falls to the lot of no other science which has to do

metaphysics  purifie,completion:d by criticism  and thereby reduced to a permanent
condition?
prompt:A cursory view of the present work will lead to the
supposition that its use is merely _negative_  that,completion: it only serves to
warn us against venturing  with speculative reason  beyond the limits
of experience.
prompt:This is  in fact ,completion: its primary use.
prompt:But this  at once 
assumes a _positive_ value  when we observe that the principles with
which speculative reason endeavours to transcend its limits lead
inevitably  not to the _extension_  but to the _contracti,completion:on_ of the use
of reason  inasmuch as they threaten to extend the limits of
sensibility  which is their proper sphere  over the entire realm of
thought and  thus  to supplant the pure (practical) use of reason.
prompt:So
far  then  as this criticism is occupied in confining speculative
reason within its proper bounds  it is only negative; but  inasmuch as
it thereby  at t,completion:he same time  removes an obstacle which impedes and
even threatens to destroy the use of practical reason  it possesses a
positive and very important value.
prompt:In order to admit this  we have only
to be convinced that there is an absolutely necessary use of pure
reason—the moral use—in which it inevitably transcends the limit,completion:
prompt:To deny the positive advantage of the
service which this criticism renders us would be as absurd as to
maintain that the system of police is productive of no positiv,completion:
prompt:That space and time are only forms of
sensible intuition  and hence are only conditions of the existence of
things as phenomena; that  moreover  we have no conceptions of the
understanding  and  consequently  no elements for the cognition of
things  except in so far as a corresponding intuition can be given to
these conceptions; that ,completion: accordingly  we can have no cognition of an
object  as a thing in itself  but only as an object of sensible
intuition  that is  as phenomenon—all this is proved in the analytical
part of the Critique; and from this the limitation of all possible
speculative cognition to the mere objects of _experience_  follows as a
necessary result.
prompt:At the same time  it must be carefully borne in mind
that  while we surrender the power o,completion:f _cognizing_  we still reserve the
power of _thinking_ objects  as things in themselves.

prompt:Suppose now  on
the other hand  that we _have_ undertaken this criticism  and have
learnt that an object may be taken in _two senses_  first  as a
phenomenon  secondly  as ,completion:a thing in itself; and that  according to the
deduction of the conceptions of the understanding  the principle of
causality has reference only to things in the first sense.
prompt:We then see
how it does not involve any contradiction to assert  on the one hand 
that the will  in the phenomenal sphere—in visible action—is
necessarily obedient to th,completion:e law of nature  and  in so far  _not free;_
and  on the other hand  that  as belonging to a thing in itself  it is
not subject to that law  and  accordingly  is _free_.
prompt:Now  it is true
that I cannot  by means of speculative reason  and still less by
empirical observation  _cognize_ my soul as a thi,completion:ng in itself and
consequently  cannot cognize liberty as the property of a being to
which I ascribe effects in the world of sense.

cognize this being as existing  and yet not in time ,completion:

principles _à pri,completion:ori_  which were absolutely impossible without this

had proved that liberty was incapable of being thought at all.

science  as well as for those of society  to favour a criticism of this
kind  by which alone the labours of reason can be e,completion:stablished on a firm
basis  than to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools  which
raise a loud cry of danger to the public over the destruction of
cobwebs  of which the public has never taken any notice  and the loss

reason in pure cognition; for pure cognition must always be dogmatic 
that is  must rest on strict demonstration from sure principles _à

 there are things external to me related to my sense as I am that I
 myself exist as determined in time.
prompt:But in order to ascertain to what
 given intuitions objects  external me  really correspond  in other
 words  what intuitions belong to the external sense and not to
 imagination  I must have recourse  in every particular case  to those
 rules according to which experience in general (even internal
 experience) is distinguished from imagination  and which are always
 based on the proposition that there really is an external
 experience.—We may add the remark that the representation of something
 _permanent_ in existence  is not,completion: the same thing as the _permanent
 representation;_ for a representation may be very variable and
 changing—as all our representations  even that of matter  are—and yet
 refer to something permanent  which must  therefore  be distinct from
 all my representations and external to me  the existence of which is
 necessarily included in the determination of my own existence  and
 with it constitutes _one_ experience—an experience which would not
 even be possible internally  if it were not also at the same time  in
 part  external.

prompt:We never can imagine or make
a representation to ourselves of the non-existenc,completion:e of space  though we
may easily enough think that no objects are found in it.
prompt:It must 
therefore  be considered as the condition of the possibility of
phenomena  and by no means as a determinati,completion:on dependent on them  and is
a representation à priori  which necessarily supplies the basis for
external phenomena.
prompt:3,completion:.
prompt:Space is no discursive  or as we say  general concept,completion:ion of the
relations of things  but a pure intuition.
prompt:For  in the first place  we

of objects such as attaches to the objects themselves  and would
remain  even though all subjective conditions of the intuition were
abstracted.
prompt:For neither absolute nor relative determinations of objects
can be intuited prior,completion: to the existence of the things to which they
belong  and therefore not à priori.

prompt:It is therefore from the human point of view only ,completion:that we can speak of
space  extended objects  etc.
prompt:If we depart from the subjective
condition  under which alone we can obtain external intuition  or  in
other,completion: words  by means of which we are affected by objects  the
representation of space has no meaning whatsoever.
prompt:This predicate is
only applicable to things in so far as,completion: they appear to us  that is  are
objects of sensibility.
prompt:The constant form of this receptivity  which we
call sensibility  is a necessary condition of all relations in which
objects can be in,completion:tuited as existing without us  and when abstraction of
these objects is made  is a pure intuition  to which we give the name
of space.
prompt:It is clear that we cannot make the special conditions of
sensibility into conditions of the pos,completion:sibility of things  but only of
the possibility of their existence as far as they are phenomena.
prompt:And so
we may correctly say that space contains all which can appear to us

prompt:As to the
intuitions of other thinking beings  we cannot judge whether they are

and which for us are universally valid.
prompt:If we join the limitation of a
judgement to the conception of the,completion: subject  then the judgement will
possess unconditioned validity.
prompt:For example  the proposition  “All
objects are beside each other in space ” is valid onl,completion:y under the
limitation that these things are taken as objects of our sensuous
intuition.

prompt:We maintain  therefore  the empirical reality of space
in regard to all possible external experience  although we must admit
its transcendental ideality; in other words  that ,completion:it is nothing  so

prompt:(See ,completion:§ 3.)

agree in this respect with the representation of space  that they
belong merely to the subjective nature of the mode of sensuous

prompt:On the contrary  the transcendental conception of
phenomena in space is a critical admonition  that  in general  nothing
which is intuited in space is a thing in itself  and that space is not
a form which belongs as a property to things; but that objects are
quite unknown to us in themselves,completion:  and what we call outward objects

prompt:(a) Time is not something which subsists of itself  or which inheres in

abstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition of
things.
prompt:For in the former case  it would be something real  yet wit,completion:hout

prompt:In the latter
case  as an order or determination inherent in things themselves  it
could not be anteceden,completion:t to things  as their condition  nor discerned or
intuited by means of synthetical propositions à priori.

quite possible when we regard time as merely the,completion: subjective condition
under which all our intuitions take place.

of the inward intuition can be ,completion:

prompt:And precisely because this
internal intuition presents to us no shape or form  we endeavour to
supply this want by analogies  and represent the course of time by a
line progressing to infinity  the content of which constitutes a ,completion:series
which is only of one dimension; and we conclude from the properties of
this line as to all the properties of time  with this single exception 
that the parts of the line are coexistent  whilst those of time are
successive.

is itself an int,completion:
prompt:(c) Time is the formal condition à ,completion:priori of all phenomena whatsoever.
prompt:Space  as the pure form of external intuition  is limit,completion:ed as a
condition à priori to external phenomena alone.
prompt:On the other hand 
because all representations  whether they have or have not external
things for their objects  still in themselves  as determinations of the
mind  belong to our internal state; and because this internal state is
su,completion:bject to the formal condition of the internal intuition  that is  to
time—time is a condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever—the
immediate condition of all internal  and thereby the mediate condition
of all external phenomena.
prompt:If I can say à priori  “All outward
phenomena are in space  and determined à priori according to the
relations of space ” I can also  from the principle of the internal
sense  affirm universally  “All phenomena in general  that is  all
objects of the senses  are in time and stand necessari,completion:ly in relations
of time.”

If we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external
intuitions  possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and
presented to us by our faculty of representation  and consequently take
objects as they are in themselves  then time is nothing.

objective validity in regard to phenomena  beca,completion:

prompt:This
ideality  like that of space  is not to be proved or illustrated by
fallacious analogies with sensations  for this reason—that in such
arguments or illustrations  we make the presupposition that the
phen,completion:omenon  in which such and such predicates inhere  has objective

as is itself empirical  that is  regards the object as a mere

internal sense (that is,completion:  myself and my internal state) is clear
immediately through consciousness.
prompt:The former—external objects in
space—might be a mere delusion  but ,completion:the latter—the object of my
internal perception—is undeniably real.
prompt:They do not  however  reflect
that both  without question of their reality as representations  belong

prompt:For such
certainty cannot be found in an à posteriori proposition; and the
conceptions à priori of space and time are  according to this opinion 
mere creations of the imagination  having their source really in
experience  inasmuch as ,completion: out of relations abstracted from experience 
imagination has made up something which contains  indeed  general
statements of these relations  yet of which no application can be made

prompt:On the other hand  these very
conditions (space and time) embarrass them gr,completion:eatly  when the

has  indeed  this advantage  that the representations of space and time
do not come in their wa,completion:y when they wish to judge of objects  not as
phenomena  but merely in their relation to the understanding.

pure intuition.

cognition of our own mode of intuition  that is of our sensibility  and
this always under the conditions originally attaching to the subject 
namely,completion:  the conditions of space and time; while the question: “What are
objects considered as things in themselves?” remains unanswerable even
after the most thorough examination of the phenomenal world.
prompt:To say  then  that all our sensibility is nothing but the confused
representation of things containing exclusively that which belongs to
them as things in themselves  and this under an accumulation of
characteristi,completion:c marks and partial representations which we cannot
distinguish in consciousness  is a falsification of the conception of
sensibility and phenomenization  which renders our whole doctrine
thereof empty and useless.
prompt:The difference between a confused and a
clear representat,completion:ion is merely logical and has nothing to do with
content.
prompt:No doubt the conception of right  as employed by a sound
understanding  contains all that the most subtle investigation could
unfold from ,completion:it  although  in the ordinary practical use of the word  we
are not conscious of the manifold representations comprised in the
conception.
prompt:But we cannot for this reason assert that the ordinary
conception is a sensuous one  containing a mere phenomenon  for right
cannot appear as a phenome,completion:
prompt:On the other hand  the
representation in intuition of a body contains nothing which could
belong to an object considered as a thing in itself  but merely the
phenomenon or appearance of something  and the mode in which we are
affected by tha,completion:t appearance; and this receptivity of our faculty of
cognition is called sensibility  and remains toto caelo different from
the cognition of an object in itself  even though we should examine the
content of the phenomenon to the very bottom.
prompt:It must be admitted that the Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy has assigned
an entirely erroneous point of view to all investigations into the
nature and origin of our cognitions  inasmuch as it regards th,completion:

faculty of sensibility not only does not present us with an indistinct

objects as things in themselves  although in the whole range of the
sensuous world  investigate the nature of its objects as profoundly as
we may  we have to do with nothing but phenomena.

rainbow a mere appearance of phenomenon in a sunny shower  and the
rain  the reality or thing in itself; and this is right enough  if we
understand the latter conception in a ,completion:merely physical sense  that is 
as that which in universal experience  and under whatever conditions of
sensuous perception  is known in intuition to be so and so determined 
and not otherwise.

if this subjective condition were not in respect to its form also the
universal condition à priori under which alone the object of this
external intuition is itself possible; if the object ,completion:(that is  the
triangle) were something in itself  without relation to you the
subject; how could you affirm that that which lies necessarily in your
subjective conditions in order to construct a triangle  must also
necessarily belong to the triangle in itself?

construct any synthetical proposition whatsoever regarding external
objects.

the internal intuition  the representation of the external senses

prompt:Now that which  as representation  can
antecede every exercise of thought (of an object)  is intuition; and
when it contains nothing but relations  it is the form of the
intuition  which  as it presents us with no representation  except in
so far as something is placed in the,completion: mind  can be nothing else than the
mode in which the mind is affected by its own activity  to wit—its
presenting to itself representations  consequently the mode in which
the mind is affected by itself; that is  it can be nothing but an
internal sense in respect to its form.

through the medium of sense is so far phenomenal; consequently  we must

here lies wholly in the question: How ,completion:can the subject have an internal
intuition of itself?

prompt:The
consciousness of self (apperception) is the simple representation of
the “ego”; and if by means of that representation alon,completion:e  all the
manifold representations in the subject were spontaneously given  then
our internal intuition would be intellectual.

existence  and reflect on the absurdities in which we then find
ourselves involved  inasmuch as we are compelled to admit the existence
of two infinite things  which are neverthe,completion:less not substances  nor
anything really inhering in substances  nay  to admit that they are the
necessary conditions of the existence of all things  and moreover  that
they must continue to exist  although all existing things were
annihilated—we cannot blame the good Berkeley for degrading bodies to
mere illusory appearances.
prompt:Nay  even our own existence  which would in
this case depend upon the self-existent reality of such a mere
nonentity a,completion:s time  would necessarily be changed with it into mere
appearance—an absurdity which no one has as yet been guilty of.
prompt:[12] The predicates of the phenomenon can be affixed to the object

 colour or the perfume to the rose.
prompt:But (illusory) appearance never can
 be attributed as a predicate to an object  for this very reason  that

say  we form to ourselves  by anticipation  the idea of a science of
pure understanding and rational cognition  by means of which we may
cogitate objects entirely à priori.
prompt:A science of this kind  which
should determine the origin  the extent  and the objective validity of
such cognitions  must be called transcendental logic  because it has
not  like general logic  to ,completion:do with the laws of understanding and
reason in relation to empirical as well as pure rational cognitions
without distinction  but concerns itself with these only in an à priori
relation to objects.

prompt:For if a question be in itself
absurd and unsusceptible of a rational answer  it is attended with the
danger—not to mention the shame that falls upon the person who proposes
it—of seducing the unguarded listener into making absurd answers  and
we are presented with the ridiculous spectacle of one (as the ancients
said) “milking t,completion:he he-goat  and the other holding a sieve.”

If truth consists in the accordance of a cognition with its object 
this object must be  ipso facto  distinguished from all others; for a
cognition is false if it does not accord with the object to which it
relates  although it contains something which may be affirmed of other
objects.
prompt:Now an universal criterion of truth would be that which is

is evident that since  in the case of such a criterion  we make

prompt:As we have already

On the other hand  with re,completion:
prompt:Whatever contradicts these rules is false  because thereby the
understanding is ma,completion:de to contradict its own universal laws of thought;
that is  to contradict itself.
prompt:These criteria  however  apply solely to
the form of truth  that is  of thoug,completion:ht in general  and in so far they
are perfectly accurate  yet not sufficient.
prompt:For although a cognition
may be perfectly accurate as to logical form  that is  not
self-contrad,completion:ictory  it is notwithstanding quite possible that it may
not stand in agreement with its object.
prompt:Consequently  the merely
logical criterion of truth  namely  the accordance of a cognition with
the universal and forma,completion:l laws of understanding and reason  is nothing
more than the conditio sine qua non  or negative condition of all
truth.
prompt:Farther than this logic cannot go  and the error which depends
not on th,completion:e form  but on the content of the cognition  it has no test to
discover.
prompt:General logic  then  resolves the whole formal business of
understanding and reason into,completion: its elements  and exhibits them as
principles of all logical judging of our cognitions.
prompt:This part of logic
may  therefore  be called analytic  and is at least the negative test
of truth  because all cognitions must first of an be estimated and
tried accord,completion:ing to these laws before we proceed to investigate them in
respect of their content  in order to discover whether they contain
positive truth in regard to their object.
prompt:Because  however  the mere
form of a cognition  accurately as it may accord with logical laws  is
insufficient to supply us with material (objective) truth  no one  by
means of logic alone  can venture to predicate anything of or decide
concerning objects  unles,completion:
prompt:Notwithstanding  there lies so seductive a charm in the
possession of a specious art like this—an art which gives to all our
cognitions the form of the understanding  although with respect to the
content thereof we may be sadly de,completion:ficient—that general logic  which is
merely a canon of judgement  has been employed as an organon for the
actual production  or rather for the semblance of production  of
objective assertions  and has thus been grossly misapplied.
prompt:Now general
logic  in its assumed char,completion:acter of organon  is called dialectic.
prompt:Different as are the significations in which the ancients used this
term for a science or an art  we may safely infer  from their actual
employment of it  that with them it was nothing else than a logic of
illusion—a sophi,completion:stical art for giving ignorance  nay  even intentional
sophistries  the colouring of truth  in which the thoroughness of
procedure which logic requires was imitated  and their topic employed
to cloak the empty pretensions.
prompt:Now it may be taken as a safe and
useful warning  that general logic  considered as an organon  must
always be a logic of illusion  that is  be dialectical  for  as it
teaches us nothing whatever respecting the content of our cognitions 
but merely the formal conditions of their accordance with the
understanding,completion:  which do not relate to and are quite indifferent in
respect of objects  any attempt to employ it as an instrument (organon)

runs the risk of making  by means of empty sophisms  a material and

momenta.

prompt:The singular
judgement relates to the general one  as unity t,completion:o infinity  and is
therefore in itself essentially different.
prompt:Thus  if we estimate a
singular judgement (_judicium singulare_) not merely according to its
intrinsic validity as a judgement  but also as a cognition generally 
according to its quantity in comparison with that of other cognitions 
it is then entirely different f,completion:rom a general judgement (_judicium

“It is not mortal”—by ,completion:this negative judgement I should at least ward

are connected in one sphere  so the understanding represents to itself
the parts of the latter  as having—each of them—an existence (as

prompt:Of the Application of the Categories to Objects of the Senses in
general § 20

The pure conceptions of the understanding apply to objects of intuition
in general  through the understanding alone,completion:
prompt:The synthesis or conjunction of the
manifold in these conceptions relates  we have said  only to the unity
of apperception  and is ,completion:for this reason the ground of the possibility
of à priori cognition  in so far as this cognition is dependent on the
understanding.
prompt:This synthesis is  therefore  not merely tr,completion:anscendental 
but also purely intellectual.
prompt:But because a certain form of sensuous
intuition exists in the mind à priori which rests on the receptivity of
the representative faculty (sensibility)  the understanding  as a
spontaneity  is able to determine the internal sense by means of the
diversity of given re,completion:presentations  conformably to the synthetical
unity of apperception  and thus to cogitate the synthetical unity of
the apperception of the manifold of sensuous intuition à priori  as the
condition to which must necessarily be submitted all objects of human
intuition.
prompt:And in this manner the categories as mere forms of thought
receive objective reality  that is  application to objects which ar,completion:e
given to us in intuition  but that only as phenomena  for it is only of
phenomena that we are capable of à priori intuition.
prompt:This synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition  which is possible
and necessary à priori  may be called figurative (synthesis speciosa) 
in contradistinction to that which,completion: is cogitated in the mere category in
regard to the manifold of an intuition in general  and is called
connection or conjunction of the understanding (synthesis
intellectualis).
prompt:Both are transcendental  not merely because they
themselves precede à priori all experien,completion:ce  but also because they form
the basis for the possibility of other cognition à priori.
prompt:But the figurative synthesis  when it has relation only to the
originally synthetical unity of apperception  that is to the
transcendental unity cogi,completion:tated in the categories  must  to be
distinguished from the purely intellectual conjunction  be entitled the
transcendental synthesis of imagination.
prompt:Imagination is the faculty of
representing an ,completion:object even without its presence in intuition.
prompt:Now  as
all our intuition is sensuous  imagination  by reason of the subjective
condition under which alo,completion:ne it can give a corresponding intuition to
the conceptions of the understanding  belongs to sensibility.
prompt:But in so
far as the synthesis of the imagination is an act of spontaneity  which
is determinative  and not  like sense  merely determinable  and which
is consequently able to determine sense à priori  according to its
form  conf,completion:
prompt:It is an operation of the
understanding on sensibility  and the first application of the
understanding to object,completion:s of possible intuition  and at the same time
the basis for the exercise of the other functions of that faculty.
prompt:As
figurative  it is distinguished from the merely intellectual synthesis 
w,completion:hich is produced by the understanding alone  without the aid of
imagination.
prompt:Now  in so far as imagination is spontaneity  I sometimes
call it also the productive imagination  and distinguish it from the
reproductive  the synthesis of which is subject entirely to empirical
laws  those,completion: of association  namely  and which  therefore  contributes
nothing to the explanation of the possibility of à priori cognition 
and for this reason belongs not to transcendental philosophy  but to
psychology.
prompt:We have now arrived at the proper place for explaining the paradox
which must have struck every one in our exposition of the internal
sense (§ 6)  namely—how this sense r,completion:epresents us to our own
consciousness  only as we appear to ourselves  not as we are in
ourselves  because  to wit  we intuite ourselves only as we are
inwardly affected.
prompt:Now this appears to be contradictory  inasmuch as we
thus stand in a passive relation to ourselves; and therefore in the
systems of psychol,completion:ogy  the internal sense is commonly held to be one
with the faculty of apperception  while we  on the contrary  carefully
distinguish them.
prompt:That which determines the internal sense is the understanding  and its
original power of conjoining the manifold of int,completion:uition  that is  of
bringing this under an apperception (upon which rests the possibility
of the understanding itself).
prompt:Now  as the human understanding is not in
itself a faculty of intuition  and is unable to exercise such a power 
in order to conjoin  as it were  the manifold of its own intuition  the
synthesis of understanding is  considered per se  nothing but the,completion:
prompt:Thus  under the name of a
transcendental synthesis of imagination  the understanding exercises an
activity upon th,completion:e passive subject  whose faculty it is; and so we are
right in saying that the internal sense is affected thereby.

with the internal sense.
prompt:The former  as the source of all our
synthetical conjunction  applies  under the name of the c,completion:
prompt:The internal sense  on the contrary  contains merely the
form of intuition  but without any synthetical conjunction of the
manifold therein  and consequently does not contain any determined

determination of the manifold by the transcendental act of the
imagination (synthetical influence of the understanding on the internal
sense)  which I have named figurative synthesis.

geometrical line without drawing it in thought  nor a circle without
describing it  nor repr,completion:esent the three dimensions of space without

prompt:At the same time  how “I who think” is distinct from the “i”
which intuites itself (other modes of intuition being cogitable as at
least possible)  and yet one and the same with this latter as the same
subject; how  therefore  I am able to say: “I  as an intelligence and
thinking subject  cognize myself as an object thought  so far as I am 
moreover  given to myself in intuition—only  like other phenomena  not
as I am in myself  and as considered by the understanding  but merely
as I appear”—is a question that has in it neither more nor less
difficulty than the question—“How can I be an object to myself?” or
this—“How I can be an ,completion:object of my own intuition and internal
perceptions?” But that such must be the fact  if we admit that space is
merely a pure form of the phenomena of external sense  can be clearly
proved by the consideration that we cannot represent time  which is not
an object of external intuition  in any other way than under the image
of a line  which we draw in thought  a mode of representation without
which we could not cognize the unity of its dimension  and also that we
are necessitated to take our determination of periods of time  or of
points of time  for all our internal perceptions from the changes which
we perceive in outward things.

prompt:Transcendental Deduction of the universally possible employment in
experience of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding § 22

In the metaphysical deduction  the à priori origin of categories was
proved by their complete accordance with the general logical of
thought; in the transcendental deduction was exhibited the possibility
of the categories as à priori cognitions of objects of an intuit,completion:ion in
general (§ 16 and 17).At present we are about to explain the
possibility of cognizing  à priori  by means of the categories  all
objects which can possibly be presented to our senses  not  indeed 
according to the form of their intuition  but according to the laws of
their conjunction or synthesis  and thus  as it were  of prescribing
laws to nature and even of rendering nature possible.

why everything that is pre,completion:

in the representations of space and time  and to these must the
synthesis ,completion:of apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon be always
comformable  because the synthesis itself can only take place according
to these forms.

at the same time.” Not to mention the superfluousness of the addition
of the word impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty  which
ought to be self-evident from the ,completion:proposition itself  the proposition
is affected by the condition of time  and as it were says: “A thing =
A  which is something = B  cannot at the same time be non-B.” But both 
B as well as non-B  may quite well exist in succession.
prompt:For example  a
man who is young cannot at the same time be old; but the same m,completion:an can
very well be at one time young  and at another not young  that is  old.
prompt:Now the principle of contradiction as a merely logical proposition must
not by any means limit its application ,completion:

added  for he who is at one time ignorant  may at another be learned.

analytical  because the characteristic ignorance is now a constituent
part of the conception of the subject; and in this case the negative
proposition is evident immediately fro,completion:m the proposition of
contradiction  without the necessity of adding the condition “the same

prompt:If we consider this reality as
cause (be it of sensation or of another reality in the phenomenon  for

possible  which can prove  either immediately or mediately  an entire
absence of all reality in a phenomenon; in other words  it is
impossible ever to draw from experience a proof of the existence of
empty space or of empty time.
prompt:For in the first place  an entire absence
of reality in a sensuous intuition cannot of course be an object of
perception; secondly  such absence cannot be deduced f,completion:rom the
contemplation of any single phenomenon  and the difference of the
degrees in its reality; nor ought it ever to be admitted in explanation
of any phenomenon.
prompt:For if even the complete intuition of a determinate
space or time is thoroughly real  that is  if no part thereof is empty 
yet because every reality has its degree  which  with the extensive

in assuming that the real in space (I must not here call it

always identical  and can only be distinguished according to its

its degree (of resistance or of weight)  which  without diminution of

significancy cannot consist in a relation to another representation (of
that which we desire to term object)  for in that case the question

reverse the order of succession  and make that which happens precede
that upon whi,completion:ch it follows; and that  in the second place  if the
antecedent state be posited  a certain determinate event inevitably and
necessarily follows.

prompt:For all experience and for the possibility of experience  understanding
is indispensable  and the first step which it takes in thi,completion:s sphere is
not to render the representation of objects clear  but to render the

applying the order of ,completion:
prompt:In other
words  it assigns to each phenomenon  as a consequence  a place in
relation to preceding phenomena  determined à ,completion:priori in time  without
which it could not harmonize with time itself  which determines a place
à priori to all its parts.
prompt:This determination of place cannot be
derived from the relation of phenomena to absolute time (for it is not
an object of perception); but ,completion: on the contrary  phenomena must
reciprocally determine the places in time of one another  and render
these necessary in the order of time.
prompt:In other words  whatever follows
or happens  must follow in conformity wi,completion:th a universal rule upon that
which was contained in the foregoing state.

prompt:If  then  my
perception is to contain the cognition of an event  that is  of
something which really happens  it must be an empirical judgement 
wherein we t,completion:hink that the succession is determined; that is  it
presupposes another phenomenon  upon which this event follows
necessarily  or in conformity with a rule.
prompt:If  on the contrary  when I
posited the antecedent  the event did not necessarily follow  I should
be obliged to consider it merely as ,completion:a subjective play of my
imagination  and if in this I represented to myself anything as
objective  I must look upon it as a mere dream.
prompt:Thus  the relation of
phenomena (as possible perceptions)  according to which that which
happens is  as to its existence  necessarily determined in time by
something which antecedes  in conformity with a rule—in other w,completion:ords 
the relation of cause and effect—is the condition of the objective
validity of our empirical judgements in regard to the sequence of
perceptions  consequently of their empirical truth  and therefore of
experience.

only when considered as formal and objective conditions of an

from the conception of it alone (which is certainly independent of,completion:
experience); for we can certainly give to the conception a
corresponding object completely à priori  that is to say  we can
construct it.

remain a mere product of the imagination  and the possibility of the
existence of an object corresponding to it mus,completion:t remain doubtful  unless
we can discover some other ground  unless we know that the figure can
be cogitated under the conditions upon which all objects of experience

is a thing which is in itself impossible  and that consequently the
objects in space are mere products of the imagination.

comparatively à priori  that is  relatively to some other previously
given existence—a cognition  however  which can only be of such an
existence as mus,completion:t be contained in the complex of experience  of which
the previously given perception is a part—the necessity of existence
can never be cognized from conceptions  but always  on the contrary 
from its connection with that which is an object of perception.
prompt:But the
only existence cognized  under the condition of other given phenomena 
as necessar,completion:y  is the existence of effects from given causes in
conformity with the laws of causality.

of things as substances  because these can never be considered as
empirical effects  or as something that happens and has a beginning.
prompt:Necessity  therefore  regards only the relations of phenomena according
to the dynamical law of causality  and the possib,completion:ility grounded
thereon  of reasoning from some given existence (of a cause) à priori
to another existence (of an effect).
prompt:“Everything that happens is

the proposition  “Nothing happens by blind chance (,completion:in mundo non datur

that is  could not à priori through the un,completion:derstanding cognize the
existence of such a thing; but it does not hence follow that this is
also the condition of the possibility of the thing itself that is said
to be contingent.
prompt:If  accordingly; we look back to our proof of the

conceptions  is not to be denied.
prompt:But in this case the conception of
the contingent is cogitated as involving not the category of modality

space; the existence of which in different spaces (as a consequence of
opposite determinations) alone makes the intuition of change possible.
prompt:For  in order to make even internal change cognitable  we require to

forbid us to pass beyond the conceptions and render all empirical use
of them impossible.
prompt:And thus these limitations prove that the
representation of an object as a thing in general is not only
insufficient  but  without sensuous determination and independently of
empirical conditions  self-contradictory; that we must therefore make

intellectual cognition  which professes to determine its objects
without the intervention of the senses.

these ,completion:false principles  is of great utility in determining with
certainty the proper limits of the understanding.

prompt:When 
therefore  I abstract all conditions of intuition  and confine myself
solely to the conception of a thing in general  I can make abstraction
,completion:of all external relations  and there must nevertheless remain a
conception of that which indicates no relation  but merely internal
determinations.
prompt:Now it seems to follow that in everything (substance)
there is something which is absolutely internal and which antecedes all
external determinations  inasmuch as it renders them possible; and that
therefore this substratum is something which does not contain any
external relations and is consequently simple (for corporeal things are
never anything but relations  at leas,completion:t of their parts external to each
other); and  inasmuch as we know of no other absolutely internal
determinations than those of the internal sense  this substratum is not
only simple  but also  analogously with our internal sense  determined
through representations  that is to say  all things are properly
monads  or simple beings endowed with the power of representation.

substratum which could not be cognized through conceptions alone  I
ca,completion:nnot say: because a thing cannot be represented by mere conceptions
without something absolutely internal  there is also  in the things
themselves which are contained under these conceptions  and in their
intuition nothing external to which something absolutely internal does
not serve as the foundation.
prompt:For  when we have made abstraction of all
the conditions of intuition  there certainly remains in th,completion:e mere

external is possible.

abstraction alone  does not obtain in the case of things themselves  in

objects of a non-sensuous intuition  in respect of which our categories
are not valid  and of whi,completion:ch we can accordingly have no knowledge

noumena must be admitted.
prompt:For this is no more than saying that our mode
of intuition is not applicable to all things  but only to objects of
our senses  that consequently it,completion:s objective validity is limited  and
that room is therefore left for another kind of intuition  and thus
also for things that may be objects of it.
prompt:But in this sense the
conception of a noumenon is problematical  that is to say  it is the
notion of that it that it is possible  nor that it is impossible 
inasmuch as we do not know of any mod,completion:e of intuition besides the
sensuous  or of any other sort of conceptions than the categories—a
mode of intuition and a kind of conception neither of which is
applicable to a non-sensuous object.

our sensibility  and,completion:
prompt:For it must be confessed of the categories that they are

we cannot call a noumenon an object of pure thought; for the

understanding from ours  both of which are consequently themselves
problematical.
prompt:The conception of a noumenon is therefore not the
conception of an object  but merely a,completion: problematical conception
inseparably connected with the limitation of our sensibility.
prompt:That is
to say  this conception contains the answer to the question: “Are there
objects quite unconnected,completion: with  and independent of  our intuition?”—a
question to which only an indeterminate answer can be given.
prompt:That
answer is: “Inasmuch as sensuous intuition does not apply to all things
without distinction  there remains room for other and different
objects.” The existence of these problematical objects is,completion: therefore not
absolutely denied  in the absence of a determinate conception of them 
but  as no category is valid in respect of them  neither must they be
admitted as objects for our understanding.
prompt:Understanding accordingly limits sensibility  w,completion:
prompt:While  moreover  it forbids sensibility to
apply its forms and modes to things in themselves and restricts it to
the sphere of phenomena  it cogitates an object in itself  only 
however  as a transcendental object  which is the cause of a phenomenon
(consequently not itself a phenomenon)  and which cannot be thought
either as a quantity or ,completion:as reality  or as substance (because these
conceptions always require sensuous forms in which to determine an
object)—an object  therefore  of which we are quite unable to say
whether it can be met with in ourselves or out of us  whether it would
be annihilated together with sensibility  or  if this were taken away 
would continue to exist.
prompt:If we wish to call this object a noumenon 
because the repre,completion:sentation of it is non-sensuous  we are at liberty to
do so.
prompt:But as we can apply to it none of the conceptions of our
understanding  the representation is for us quite void  and is
available only for the indication of the limits of our,completion: sensuous
intuition  thereby leaving at the same time an empty space  which we
are competent to fill by the aid neither of possible experience  nor of
the pure understanding.
prompt:The critique of the pure understanding  accordingly  does not permit us
to create for ourselves a new field of objects beyond those which are

a perfectly excusable one—lies in the fact that the employment of the

is that apperception  and with it though,completion:t  antecedes all possible
determinate arrangement of representations.
prompt:Accordingly we think
something in general and determine it on the one hand sensuously  but 
on the other,completion:  distinguish the general and in abstracto represented
object from this particular mode of intuiting it.
prompt:In this case there
remains a mode of determining the object by mere thought  which is
really but a logical form without content  which  howev,completion:er  seems to us
to be a mode of the existence of the object in itself (noumenon)

corresponding division of the conception of something does not require

We see that the ens rationis is distinguished from the nihil negativum
or pure nothing by the consideration that the former must not be

the question which w,completion:e have at present to answer.

might contribute to the convenience and the enlargement of the sphere
of the understanding  or in expecting that it will itself thus receive

prompt:That everything which happens has a cause  is no,completion:t

prompt:This principle makes the
unity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason  which 
without a refere,completion:nce to possible experience  could never have produced
by means of mere conceptions any such synthetical unity.
prompt:2,completion:.
prompt:Reason  in its logical use  endeavours to discover the general
condition of its judgement (the conclusion)  and a syll,completion:ogism is itself
nothing but a judgement by means of the subsumption of its condition
under a general rule (the major).
prompt:Now as this rule may itself be
subjected to the same process of reason  and thus the condition of the
condition be sought (by means of a prosyllogism) as long as the process
can be continued  it is,completion: very manifest that the peculiar principle of
reason in its logical use is to find for the conditioned cognition of
the understanding the unconditioned whereby the unity of the former is
completed.
prompt:But this logical maxim cannot be a principle of pure reason  unless we
admit that  if the conditioned is given  the whole series of conditions

any su,completion:ch objectively valid proposition of reason  and whether it is
not  on the contrary  a merely logical precept which directs us to
ascend perpetually to still higher conditions  to approach completeness
in the series of them  and thus to introduce into our cognition the
highest possible unity of reason.
prompt:We must ascertain  I say  whether
this requirement of reason has not been regarded  by a
misunderstanding  as a transcende,completion:ntal principle of pure reason  which
postulates a thorough completeness in the series of conditions in
objects themselves.

prompt:To coin new words is a
pretension to legislation in language which is seldom successful; and 
before recourse is taken to so desperate an expedient  it is advisable
,completion:to examine the dead and learned languages  with the hope and the
probability that we may there meet with some adequate expression of the
notion we have in our minds.

of the word has become somewhat uncertain  from carelessness or want of
caution on the part of the authors of it  it is always better to adhere
to and con,completion:firm its proper meaning—even although it may be doubtful
whether it was formerly used in exactly this sense—than to make our
labour vain by want of sufficient care to render ourselves

different import  the thought which it conveyed  and which it alone
conveyed  is lost with it.
prompt:Plato employed the expression idea in a way that plainly showed he
meant by it something which is never derived from the senses  but which
far transcends even ,completion:the conceptions of the understanding (with which
Aristotle occupied himself)  inasmuch as in experience nothing
perfectly corresponding to them could be found.

Transcendental analytic showed us how the mere logical form of our

rather  indicate the synthetical unity which alone renders possible an
empirical cognition of objects.
prompt:The form of judgements—converted into a

prompt:This
consideration warrants us to expect that the form of syllogisms  when
applied to synthetical unity of intuitions  following the rule of the
categories  will contain the origin of particular à ,completion:
prompt:The function of reason in arguments consists in the universality of a
cognition according to conceptions  ,completion:and the syllogism itself is a
judgement which is determined à priori in the whole extent of its
condition.
prompt:The proposition: “Caius is mortal ” is one which may be
obtained from experience by the aid of the understanding alone; but my
wish is to find a conception which contains the condition under which
the predicate of this judgement is given—in this case  the conception
of man—and after subsuming under this conditio,completion:n  taken in its whole
extent (all men are mortal)  I determine according to it the cognition
of the object thought  and say: “Caius is mortal.”

Hence  in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate to a
certain object  after having thought it in the major in its whole
extent under a certain condition.
prompt:This complete quantity of the extent
in relation to su,completion:ch a condition is called universality (universalitas).
prompt:To this corresponds totality (universitas) o,completion:f conditions in the
synthesis of intuitions.
prompt:The transcendental conception of reason is

We are not at present engaged with a logical dialectic  which makes
complete abst,completion:raction of the content of cognition and aims only at
unveiling the illusory appearance in the form of syllogisms.
prompt:Our
subject is transcendental dialectic  which must contain  completely à

the origin ,completion:of certain deduced conceptions  the object of which cannot
be given empirically and which therefore lie beyond the sphere of the
faculty of understanding.
prompt:We have observed  from the natural relation
which the transcendental use of our cognition  in syllogisms as well as
in judgements  must have to the logical  that there are three kinds of
dialectical arguments  corresponding to the three modes of conclus,completion:ion 
by which reason attains to cognitions on principles; and that in all it
is the business of reason to ascend from the conditioned synthesis 
beyond which the understanding never proceeds  to the unconditioned

necessarily produces the idea of the absolutely unconditioned in a

be able to give absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis  by
co,completion:ntinuing it to the unconditioned (which is not to be found in
experience  but only in the idea).

unconditioned in conception—the unconditioned being considered the
necessary condition of the absolute totality of the series.

prompt:The condition must be taken in exactly
the same signification as the relation of the conditioned to its

in an unbroken regress to this supreme condition.

their dependence on empirically-,completion:determined causes  and they thus
admitted an ascending series of empirical conditions: and in this they
are quite right.
prompt:But as they could not find in this series any primal
beginning or any highest member  they passed suddenly from the
empirical conception of contingency to the pure ,completion:category  which
presents us with a series—not sensuous  but intellectual—whose
completeness does certainly rest upon the existence of an absolutely

prompt:We found  first 
that a necessary being exists  because the whole time past contains the

of transcendental philosophy is that there is no question  relating to
an object presented to pure reason  which is insoluble by this ,completion:reason;
and that the profession of unavoidable ignorance—the problem being
alleged to be beyond the reach of our faculties—cannot free us from the
obligation to present a complete and satisfactory answer.

conception which enables us to raise the question must give us the
power of answering it; i,completion:nasmuch as the object  as in the case of right

questions to which we can demand a satisfactory answer in relation to

the object must be given in experience  and the quest,completion:ion relates to the

prompt:[58] The cosmological ideas alone
posses the peculiarity that we can presuppose the object of them and
the empirical synthesis requisite for the conception of that object to

merely to the progress of this synthesis  in so far as it must contain
absolute totality—which  however  is not empirical  as it cannot be

“What can be given in an experience in concreto” but “what is contained
in ,completion:the idea  to which the empirical synthesis must approximate.” The
question must therefore be capable of solution from the idea alone.

the idea is a creation of reason itself  which therefore cannot
,completion:disclaim the obligation to answer or refer us to the unknown object.
prompt:[58] The question  “What is the constitution of a transcendental
 object?” is unanswerable—we are unable to say what it is; bu,completion:t we can
 perceive that the question itself is nothing; because it does not
 relate to any object that can be presented to us.

 must consider all the questions raised in transcendental psychology as
 answerable and as really answered; for they relate to the
 transcendental subject of all internal phenomena  which ,completion:is not itself

conjectures  which can never b,completion:ecome certainties; because the phenomena

key to the solution of such questions cannot  therefore  be found in
our conceptions  or in pure thought  but must lie witho,completion:ut us and for

argument: “If that which is conditioned is given  the whole series of

so natural and evident  introduces as many cosmological ideas as there
are different kinds of conditions in the synthesis of phenomena  in so
